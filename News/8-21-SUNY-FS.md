Good afternoon. 

As longstanding members of UFS know, we do not frequently use this  list. In fact, aside from Three Things to Know, it is seldom used. However, this has been an extraordinary week. We have named a new chancellor, and I wanted to make sure that everyone knows. 

The executive committees of UFS, the Faculty Council of Community Colleges, and the Student Assembly, have passed, on behalf of their bodies, a resolution expressing no confidence in most of the politically appointed members of the Board of Trustees. This followed a statement to the Board earlier this week about the search for the chancellor. I wanted to ensure that everyone knew about these as well.

Best,
Gwen
