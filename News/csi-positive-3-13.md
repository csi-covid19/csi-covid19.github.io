Dear CSI Community:

I write to advise you that a member of our campus community has tested positive for the coronavirus. The student was last on campus on March 5, was asymptomatic at the time, and still does not present any symptoms. Our thoughts are with her and her family during this time.

NYS health officials who are experts on communicable diseases have advised us that because she just tested positive, has not been on campus for 8 days and did not have any symptoms at the time, that the case does not pose a risk to the CSI community.

However, out of an abundance of caution, we have notified the instructors and other students in her classes and we will do a thorough clean over the weekend of the areas on campus where the student was present.

Your health and safety are our number one priority. Everyone can do their part to help minimize the potential impact of this emerging public health threat. Continue to wash your hands regularly and whenever possible maintain social distancing. Please continue to visit the College’s website, which we routinely update with the latest information and links.

As a reminder, if you feel sick, please contact your health care provider. If you don’t have a health care provider, please call 311. Hospital staff cannot ask your immigration status or deny you care based on your ability to pay.

We are continuously monitoring this situation and will take additional actions to protect the health and safety of our campus community as necessary.

Sincerely,

William J. Fritz
President
