<p>From:</p>
<p>https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-new-york-state-pause-executive-order</p>
<hr />
<p>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo &quot;We know the most effective way to reduce the spread of this virus is through social distancing and density reduction measures,&quot; Governor Cuomo said. &quot;I have said from the start that any policy decision we make will be based on the facts, and as we get more facts we will calibrate our response accordingly. This executive order builds on the actions we have taken to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the wellbeing of our friends, colleagues and neighbors. But again, I want to remind New Yorkers that the panic we are seeing is outpacing the reality of the virus â€” and we will get through this period of time together.&quot;</p>
<p>The Governor&#39;s 10-point NYS on PAUSE plan is as follows:</p>
<p>Effective at 8PM on Sunday, March 22, all non-essential businesses statewide will be closed;</p>
<p>Non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason &#40;e.g. parties, celebrations or other social events&#41; are canceled or postponed at this time;</p>
<p>Any concentration of individuals outside their home must be limited to workers providing essential services and social distancing should be practiced;</p>
<p>When in public individuals must practice social distancing of at least six feet from others;</p>
<p>Businesses and entities that provide other essential services must implement rules that help facilitate social distancing of at least six feet;</p>
<p>Individuals should limit outdoor recreational activities to non-contact and avoid activities where they come in close contact with other people;</p>
<p>Individuals should limit use of public transportation to when absolutely necessary and should limit potential exposure by spacing out at least six feet from other riders;</p>
<p>Sick individuals should not leave their home unless to receive medical care and only after a telehealth visit to determine if leaving the home is in the best interest of their health;</p>
<p>Young people should also practice social distancing and avoid contact with vulnerable populations; and Use precautionary sanitizer practices such as using isopropyl alcohol wipes.</p>
<p>&quot;Matilda&#39;s Law&quot; includes the following rules for vulnerable populations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remain indoors;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can go outside for solitary exercise;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pre-screen all visitors and aides by taking their temperature and seeing if person is exhibiting other flu-like symptoms;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not visit households with multiple people;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wear a mask when in the company of others;</p>
</li>
<li><p>To the greatest extent possible, everyone in the presence of vulnerable people should wear a mask;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always stay at least six feet away from individuals; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not take public transportation unless urgent and absolutely necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
