Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
"We know the most effective way to reduce the spread of this virus is through social distancing and density reduction measures," Governor Cuomo said. "I have said from the start that any policy decision we make will be based on the facts, and as we get more facts we will calibrate our response accordingly. This executive order builds on the actions we have taken to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the wellbeing of our friends, colleagues and neighbors. But again, I want to remind New Yorkers that the panic we are seeing is outpacing the reality of the virus â€” and we will get through this period of time together."

The Governor's 10-point NYS on PAUSE plan is as follows:
