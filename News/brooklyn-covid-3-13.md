COVID-19 Update: Brooklyn College is Closed on Friday, March 13

Dear Brooklyn College community,

I write to inform you that a member of the Brooklyn College community tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) this evening. The student is in the hospital under medical care, and our thoughts are with her for a full and speedy recovery.

The student takes two classes on Tuesday evenings and she was last on campus on March 3. She did not develop symptoms until Thursday, March 5, and tested positive this evening, Thursday, March 12. Because she was asymptomatic at the time she was last on campus, the risk to our community is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, Brooklyn College will be closed tomorrow, Friday, March 13. All students, staff, faculty, and visitors should NOT come to any of the College's buildings.

We will use the day tomorrow to consult further with public health officials and to deep clean the building on campus where the student was. We have notified her instructors and the other students in her Tuesday night classes.

As always, if you feel sick, please contact a health care provider. If you don't have a health care provider, please call 311. Hospital staff cannot ask you about your immigration status or deny you care based on your ability to pay.

Your health and safety are our number one priority. Please continue to visit the Brooklyn College webpage at www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/coronavirus for the latest information, which we update daily.

Thank you,

Michelle J. Anderson
President
