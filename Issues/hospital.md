CSI asked all residents of the Dolphin Cove residence halls to vacate the buildings by March 26, as the campus is expected to be turned into a 1,000-bed field hospital to fight the coronavirus.

The federal government approved the plan to turn portions of the College of Staten Island’s Willowbrook campus into a field hospital and use more than 200 beds at South Beach Psychiatric Center for infected patients as the strategy to fight the deadly illness intensifies.

Two parts of the CSI campus -- the Dolphin Cove dorms and the Recreational Center -- are being eyed for the care facilities, according to communications from the school, the Advance/SILive.com previously reported.

The Army Corps of Engineers has been responsible for the transformation of civilian facilities into field hospitals, with support from the National Guard.
