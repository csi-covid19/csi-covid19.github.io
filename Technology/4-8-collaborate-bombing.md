Attn. CSI Faculty:

We have been receiving reports of unwanted guests disrupting Collaborate sessions .  Please immediately stop sending shared links to your online Collaborate sessions.  Instead, have the students sign-in to the course, and access the session by clicking on Tools, and then selecting "Blackboard Collaborate Ultra".  If your Collaborate sessions have already been disrupted, please stop using your Course Room, and create a new session for your future class meetings.  The Faculty Center is in the process of updating our training schedule to include sessions on how to keep your Collaborate meetings secure.  We will send an updated announcement as soon as the training schedule as been updated.
