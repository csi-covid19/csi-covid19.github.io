Dear Colleagues,

CIS staff has been working throughout the weekend with Adobe and I am pleased to report that Adobe has now resolved its issue recognizing the CUNY Login credentials.

Term-active CUNY students can now download Adobe Creative Cloud applications to their personal devices. Students can go to https://creativecloud.adobe.com and use their CUNY Login username to authenticate and select which Adobe Creative Cloud applications to install.

The student instructions on Accessing Adobe Creative Cloud are available online and will be available from the IT Resources for Remote Work & Teaching page.

Faculty and staff should contact their campus help desk for help with issues accessing their existing Adobe Creative Cloud license.

Brian Cohen
Vice Chancellor and University CIO
