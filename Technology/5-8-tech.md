Hello Faculty Center Info Hub Participants!

On May 4 the Faculty Center for Professional Development launched CSI’s first cohort of the NEW Blackboard Basics course introducing CUNY instructors to the various features and tools of the Blackboard platform for their teaching. The course is a multi-part, self-paced overview of all of the activities and tools needed to become proficient in the general use of Blackboard.  Faculty who successfully complete the course, receive a certificate of completion that will enable them to move into the higher level Blackboard courses being prepared for launch in June and July, including the SPS Online Teaching Essentials course being offered as part of CUNY’s Online Initiative. 

Our first cohort consisted of 42 faculty members enrolled via CUNY’s Online Initiative. Upon successful completion of this first introductory cohort we are now excited to announce we are expanding and offering the course on a weekly basis starting Monday, May 18, and opening enrollment to it campus-wide. For more information on this exciting new opportunity please attend one of the ten course introductory overview sessions being held next week.  In the introductory sessions we will explain what the Intro to Bb course is in full, how you can enroll in it, as well as, answer any questions you may have.

There is no sign-up needed to attend, simply choose one of the sessions listed below and click on the access link provided anytime within 15 minutes of the start of the session. Once clicked, Blackboard Collaborate will appear at the top of the screen. It will show the specific overview session you are joining and offer a place for you to type your name (please enter both your first and last name). Select Join Session after typing your full name.
