Organizing Course Content in Blackboard: Best Practices: When using Blackboard to deliver course materials to your students in a fully online environment, how easy it is for students to find and access what they need is extremely important. This workshop will go over some of the best ways to organize your course's content it is easily accessible by your students.

You will learn some best practices for setting up your course environment, as well as, an overview of Blackboard's navigation, course tools, communication, and assessment features. 
Keeping Collaborate Sessions Secure: How to Ensure Only Your Students Have Access:  Discusses the steps needed to ensure the security of your sessions.
