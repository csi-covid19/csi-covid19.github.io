Subject: Training and Support for Distance Learning

Dear Colleagues,

I wanted to take this opportunity to share additional information regarding training and support services that are available to you in preparation for distance learning. While we have a plethora of resources available on our website, we wanted to focus specifically on services you will need in order to migrate your course content. I would like to also stress that these services are being provided as a short-term solution and do not replace the importance of instructional design when developing your online course. Please take a moment when things settle down to visit our Distance Learning website if you wish to explore teaching online in the future.
