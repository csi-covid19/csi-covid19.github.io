Effective Online Instruction
 
Higher education has made an astonishing national transition to online learning. Traditional classrooms may be closed across campuses, but class is still in session, as faculty have gone above and beyond to ensure that their students keep learning.
 
Yet moving a course online—like being assigned to a classroom—is just the start.
 
Join nationally recognized experts in online teaching and learning for a virtual discussion on best-practices in key areas to ensure quality online instruction for student success.
 
Confirmed experts include: Flower Darby, Kevin Gannon, April Mondy, Viji Sathy, Alyson Snowe, Michael Wesch and more.
