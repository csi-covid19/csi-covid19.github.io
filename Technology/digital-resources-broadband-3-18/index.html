<hr />
<p>Colleagues,</p>
<p>I wanted to share the below digital resources that are available to you and your students. Information about free broadband is especially important for distance learning.</p>
<p>Patty</p>
<p>With an unprecedented number of schools closing and students across the country shifting to digital learning because of COVID-19, Verizon has made digital resources available to schools and teachers across the country.</p>
<p>The Verizon Innovative Learning Schools Connection website has a number of resources including tips to prepare for and implement robust digital learning plans and Verizon’s partner Digital Promise has helpful COVID-19 online learning resources and FAQs.</p>
<p>Knowing many students also rely on schools for more than learning, Verizon is working with nonprofit partners to ensure children from low-income families still have access to healthy meals while their schools are closed.</p>
<p>Altice USA and Charter Communications both announced on March 13, 2020 that they would offer free broadband services to students taking online classes.  Both providers cover different parts of New York City.</p>
<p>Charter announced that it would offer free high-speed Spectrum Internet service and Wi-Fi for 60 days to households with students taking online classes because of the coronavirus outbreak.  Students can call &#40;844&#41; 488-8395 to enroll. Installation fees will be waived for new student households, the company said.  Spectrum said regular pricing will take effect at the end of the 60-day period if a customer doesn’t cancel or change the service.  For more information, see https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-to-offer-free-access-to-spectrum-broadband-and-wifi-for-60-days-for-new-K12-and-college-student-households-and-more</p>
<p>Altice USA said that it would offer Altice Advantage 30 mgbs broadband service for free to college students without Internet service for 60 days.  Eligible students can call 866-200-9522 to enroll.  For more information see  https://www.alticeusa.com/news/articles/feature/corporate/altice-usa-brings-free-broadband-k-12-and-college-students-during-coronavirus-pandemic</p>
<p>In addition, AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and Comcast have announced additional services during the coronavirus outbreak, such as the removal of data caps and waiver of late fees.  Students should check with their individual carriers for these arrangements.  https://www.cnet.com/news/carriers-are-suspending-internet-data-caps-during-coronavirus/</p>
