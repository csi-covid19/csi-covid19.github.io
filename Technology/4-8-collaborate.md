Hello Faculty Center Info Hub Participants!

As previously reported, the Faculty Center has received multiple reports of Instructors encountering unwanted individuals within their class Collaborate sessions. As a result we will be offering emergency workshops both tomorrow (Thursday, April 9) and Friday, April 10 to go over the steps needed to ensure the security of your sessions. Please note: in general, there is no need to provide alternative access to any Collaborate session you hold inside your course(s). Students automatically have access to the online conference room as enrolled members of your course. The workshops listed below will go over the steps needed to ensure only your registered students have access to your course sessions.

As with our other weekly workshop sessions, there is no sign-up needed to participate in any of the trainings offered!  To attend, simply click on the access link provided anytime within 15 minutes of the start of the workshop. Once clicked, Blackboard Collaborate will appear at the top of the screen. It will show the specific training session you are joining and offer a place for you to type your name (please enter both your first and last name). Select Join Session after typing your full name.
