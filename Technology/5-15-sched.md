Happy Finals week to you all!  

We wanted to take a moment to first congratulate you all for getting to the finish line of this semester with us!  Your dedication to attending our workshops, information sessions, 1-on-1 tutorials, and everything else we have sent your way has been extraordinary. Thank you for being part of this wild and wonderful instructional team with us, and for giving us the opportunity to help you in any way we could!  Additionally, we also want to ensure you all that the Faculty Center for Professional Development team isn't done yet!

We are here and ready to assist you in any way possible during finals week!  In addition to launching our first cohort of our new Bb Basics course we are also expanding our Faculty Center Virtual Drop-in Center hours to better support your Blackboard and pedagogy support needs from May 15 to May 22.

Furthermore, there are still spots available in our NEW Blackboard Basics Course! 

The new Bb Basics course will give you the basic skills and certification you need to move forward teaching fully online in the summer and further prepare you for the fall 2020 semester. The course is designed to be a self-paced general overview of the basic tools and functions inside CUNY’s current installation of Blackboard. And once completed will provide you with completion certificate required for access to the higher level training courses being offered as part of CUNY’s Online Initiative Training Program.

The Faculty Center is currently offering 6 cohorts of the Bb Basics Course:

Cohort 1 – Begins on 5/18/2020,
Cohort 2 - Begins on 5/25/2020,
Cohort 3 – Begins on 6/1/2020,
Cohort 4 – Begins on 6/8/2020,
