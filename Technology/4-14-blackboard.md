Dear Faculty,
 
It’s been quite the adventure as we unexpectedly have found ourselves teaching in an online environment. For some of us, the transition has been an easy one. For others, it has been an uphill battle. However, everyone is in this together and the Training and Instructional Team will continue to be there to support your distance learning initiatives.
 
We would like to take this opportunity to invite you to a virtual workshop: Maintaining the Balance between Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning. This interactive workshop will afford you the opportunity to gain pedagogical insights from the instructional design and training team. What are the tips and tricks to using both modalities in the classroom? Does it have to be one or the other? What works and what doesn’t? In addition, faculty will be sharing their experiences – what worked and what didn’t work during their online transition.  Finally, we would love to hear from you and will be allowing time for Q &A.
 
Title:     Maintaining the Balance between Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning
Date:    April 28, 2020
