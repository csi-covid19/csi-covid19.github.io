Subject: After Hour Support for Faculty, Staff, and Students

Attention All CSI Students, Faculty and Staff

Starting tonight, students and faculty with a pressing Blackboard question can call Blackboard for assistance in using Blackboard when campus help desks and Blackboard administrators are unavailable. This after hours Blackboard support will be available by telephone:

·        weeknights - between 8:00pm and 8:00 the next morning
·        weekends – all day and night on Saturdays and Sunday

CUNY has contracted with Blackboard to provide this telephone support as an additional service to our students and faculty to ensure coverage when the campus help desks are closed and Blackboard administrator support to students and faculty is unavailable.
Please see After Hours Blackboard Support for information on how to access this after hours support service as well as examples of the Blackboard support provided.
