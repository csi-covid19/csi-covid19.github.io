Colleagues:

I hope you had a safe and enjoyable Fourth of July weekend, and that you are finding time to rest and recharge. We’ll all need energy for the fight ahead of us. PSC has a plan to talk to all faculty and staff in our bargaining unit this summer. That’s what it will take to build the support and communication we need to fight for every job and ensure a safe, appropriately timed return to in-person work, whenever that may be.

The #CUNYSummerofStruggle continues this week with a Collective Phone Bank Thursday evening. Then, we’ll have an all-out push to mobilize members for the Caravans through CUNY Communities on Saturday, July 18th at 11:00 AM. Be part of the campaign to #CutCovidNotCUNY and #MakeBillionairesPay to protect and increase funding for CUNY.
 
Fightback Thursday Collective Phone Bank
Join the experiment. Thurs., July 9, 5-7PM
The Fightback Thursday group is trying something participatory and different. We’ll host a collective phone bank this Thursday for anyone who wants to be part of the one-on-one organizing. We’ll log on to Zoom to review the phone script together, call colleagues, and regroup on Zoom for entertaining, interactive breaks! Join the effort, it should be fun! If you cannot make calls with us, please be sure to pick up your phone and talk if we call you!


Caravans through CUNY Communities
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and On Zoom, Sat., July 18, 11 AM
We’re fighting for our jobs and safety, but also for the quality of a CUNY education and the life chances of CUNY students. We’re bringing our next physically distant action to the communities where CUNY students and alumni live. Sign up here for one of four borough-based car/bike caravans, and start thinking about the signs you’ll make for your car or bike. If you don’t feel safe joining in person, sign up to participate live on Zoom and help with our online activism. Get started online by posting the flier for the Caravans event on your favorite social media.

Active in solidarity,
Andrea
