Subject: Powerful op-ed by George Sanchez published today

ï»¿
Thank you, George, for your courage in writing this important piece and for your daughter's courage in protesting racism and enduring extreme mistreatment at the hands of the police.  Anyone who has seen George's performances about gun violence and state-sanctioned violence against people of color will feel the resonance with this piece: https://www.gothamgazette.com/opinion/9497-having-a-child-arrested-peacefully-protesting-nypd. 

PSC members continue to publish some of the most important writing about this crisis.  See the growing list here.
