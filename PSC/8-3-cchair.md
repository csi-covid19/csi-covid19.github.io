Dear CSI Chapter,

I hope this finds you safe and healthy!  I also hope everyone is able to enjoy at least a little bit of this summer break!!

First, I wanted to thank everyone who either participated in the car caravan, or watched it over Zoom, Saturday, July 18!  Our CSI group had close to 40 cars participating and it turned out to be an enthusiastic energetic action.  Between participants and Zoom viewers we had at least 1300 involved!  We had strong turnouts in the four boros and the feedback was very positive.

I am also reaching out to let everyone know weâ€™ll hold our next chapter meeting this Thursday, August 6 at 2:30.  This will give us a chance to have the different committees update us on their various projects, and also to discuss the upcoming August 26 action as the fall semester begins. A Zoom link will go out on Wednesday for the Thursday chapter meeting.

In the meantime, take extra good care of yourselves and we hope to see you Thursday!
