To the CSI Community,

I hope this finds everyone safe and healthy!

First, I want to extend my full admiration and respect for all the work full-time and part-time faculty have been doing for transitioning to distance learning!  This was/is no easy task and the call to do so happened so suddenly, but due to everyone’s support and understanding of our students’ needs, it is astonishing and commendable how seamless you have made this transition. Thank you all so much for your dedication!

Secondly, I want to reach out and ask if you can please email any questions or concerns you have moving forward with anything having to with your positions.  Workplace safety, health considerations, tenure and promotion,  online or distance learning and workload?  The chapter had a labor-management meeting scheduled for Wednesday, March 18, that was postponed for obvious reasons. But as we await a new date, we are hoping to schedule this meeting sooner than later, and please forward me any questions or concerns you may have.  The chapter is acutely concerned with numerous labor and workplace safety issues and we look forward to meeting with President Fritz soon.

The chapter was on the front line advocating for people to work remotely and to close the library from the beginning of this pandemic.  We will continue to support, advocate and protect all our members and students as we move forward through this crisis.  As stated before, we are ALL in this together!
