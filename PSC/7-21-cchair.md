Dear CSI Chapter,

I hope this finds everyone safe and healthy!  As we all prepare for the start of the fall semester with much uncertainty, let me take this time to thank each of you for all you do for CSI and our students.  As chapter chair and EC member of the PSC, I've never been so busy during the summer.  But this applies to most of you as well!  There are so many people who have dedicated so much of their time to assuring we return to a safe campus, that people have jobs, and that students will receive quality education.  A we are less than a week away from the start of the fall semester, we still have much work to do to assure everyone's health and safety.  For now, I want to share two things with you for your information.

First, next Wednesday the PSC will hold its third major action with a day of action we are calling "PSC Demands Justice."  This will consist of a 24-hour online event where we will be on Zoom for 24 hours beginning Wednesday, August 26 at 8 am and continuing non-stop until 8 am Thursday, August 27.  The focus of the day will be to address the 10 demands the PSC is currently negotiating with CUNY and the Chancellor Matos.  A schedule of the day's events and contributions from all our members, and students (!), will be distributed prior to the event.  But in order to participate in the days' event, everyone must register for the event.  Please see the info and link below and make sure to register!

Secondly, I am also attaching a link to an article written by two CUNY professors, one of which is the former Vice-President of the PSC Michael Fabricant, and Steven Brier.  The article addresses the disinvestment in CUNY funding and public education.  Please read below.
