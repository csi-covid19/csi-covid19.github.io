To the CSI Community,

I hope this finds everyone safe and healthy!  It is essential everyone take extra good care of yourselves and practice shelter-in-place.  There is so much we cannot control, but there is so much we can do to stem the spread of this virus. By taking care of ourselves, we take care of each other.  Please keep in mind that we are ALL in this together.

Forgive my online absence in my communications!  As all of us are we working so hard to make many transitions to foster good will and extend compassion, I have been mired with overextended requests and needs.  But I promise to submit daily communications to help the larger communication that is called for when we find ourselves deep in a pandemic.

Please see Barbara Bowen’s most recent communication in response to Chancellor Matos-Rodriguez’s “recalibration” message.  This is important for all faculty, and staff, to be aware of.  I have heard from faculty at CSI that the Chancellor’s message was confusing and ill-timed. The PSC agrees.  As you will read in Barbara’s communication, the one college s whose Faculty Senate voted to honor the first schedule, prior to the “recalibration”, is the Borough of Manhattan Community College.  But there may be other colleges who vote to replicate the same strategy.

But please read the message below (in a different post,  ed.), and please contact me if you have any questions or responses.

Lastly, as a CSI colleague and chapter chair, I want to express my deep gratitude to every single faculty and staff member at our college.  The commitment to public education, to the CUNY mission and our students, in the face of such harrowing conditions, is why I chose to work where I do.  You are all an inspiration.
