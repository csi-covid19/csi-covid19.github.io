Good afternoon, PSC Members,

This is a short message to call on you to join a mass virtual protest today to defend CUNY from State budget cuts. First, I send my best wishes for your health, especially to any members who are themselves struggling with illness or taking care of others in this cruel epidemic.

The recent federal stimulus bill includes $14 billion for higher education, with $1 billion going to New York State. The additional federal funding should stabilize education budgets; there is no justification for cuts to CUNY!

The PSC is joining our statewide affiliate, NYSUT, in trying to generate 5,000 phone calls today to Albany legislators demanding no cuts to education. The PSC’s goal is 1,000 calls.

We are all stretched thin in this crisis, but I trust PSC members to come through and click the link to dial your state legislators automatically.  If you don’t get through, you can still send the PSC’s letter calling for full funding for CUNY.

NYSUT’s message is below. Thank you for your extraordinary work during this crisis.

Barbara Bowen
President, PSC/CUNY





New York cannot expect to fix this crisis on the backs of our students.

The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the vital role that our schools play in our communities. They provide meals, they provide care for the needs of children, they provide mental health services — and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Tell Lawmakers NO CUTS to Public Education!
The governor recently announced that school districts should be prepared to adjust their budgets to account for lost revenue from the state. The passage of the federal stimulus package infused two billion dollars to our state for public education stabilization for both K-12 and higher education. There is no need for these dramatic cuts. Cuts to education in any form will hurt the students and families who need the supports our public schools and colleges provide now more than ever. The inequality that already existed in our education system has only been exacerbated by this crisis. Cutting funding now will widen the gap even further.

Take action now at the NYSUT Member Action Center to tell lawmakers that they absolutely MUST NOT balance New York's budget on the backs of our students!

Our public education students and families shouldn't be the ones to foot the bill for the crisis. We cannot sacrifice our students' future. Stand up for our public schools and colleges — and stop these extreme cuts.

In solidarity,

Andrew Pallotta
NYSUT President


P.S. Tell lawmakers NO CUTS to education! We cannot balance the budget on the backs of our students!
