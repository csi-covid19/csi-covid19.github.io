Dear PSC colleagues -
 
We are facing a terrifying funding crisis at CUNY. Last week, CUNY announced thousands of adjunct layoffs, and hundreds of those colleagues will lose their health insurance as a result--in the middle of a global pandemic no less.
 
Of course, adjunct layoffs mean a reduction in the quality of services to our students: fewer courses offered and/or larger class sizes in those courses that are offered. This also means *more work* for those of us lucky enough to remain on payroll.
 
But there is hope in the middle of this crisis. We need greater collective power to turn that hope into money for CUNY. Let's show CUNY that we are more organized than ever before by gathering virtually or in your car on July 18th for a fight back caravan across the boroughs. The action will run from 11 am - 1 pm. For those who do not have cars, it is possible to participate digitally or by bicycle. At our last action, we trended on Twitter thanks to our hundreds of digital participants!
 
Our greatest power is our collective power, and there is simply no other way to express that power than acting together. Again, RSVP for July 18th here!
 
In solidarity,
 
George Sanchez
