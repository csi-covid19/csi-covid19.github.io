Dear PSC member,
 
I'm writing to inform you that Article XIII, section 1 (a) of the PSC constitution requires a two- thirds vote of the Delegate Assembly to propose a constitutional amendment. In accordance with this provision, on 6/25/20, a Special DA will be held for the purpose of considering two motions. Effectuating each of the motions would require a constitutional amendment.
 
Article XIII, section 1 (b) of the PSC constitution states that amendments to the constitution "shall be effective when ratified by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of the Delegate Assembly." Accordingly, if the proposal is successfully proposed by a two-thirds vote at the Special DA, the proposal will be voted on at a regularly scheduled DA later in the same day, 6/25.                            
 
The constitution further requires that the "text of any proposed amendment to be voted upon by the Delegate Assembly must be submitted to the Delegates and to the entire membership at least two (2) weeks prior to a vote of the Delegate Assembly." Please see below for the text of the proposed amendments:
 
Proposal 1: An incumbent Chapter or General Officer, Delegate or Alternate Delegate to the Delegate Assembly or to affiliates who affirms in writing that they sought continued employment in a PSC represented title, and is non-reappointed or otherwise loses their employment with a PSC bargaining unit employer, may retain such office and membership in their previous chapter for up to one year after the effective date of loss of employment provided dues in the annual amount equal to dues paid during the final year on payroll shall be paid directly to the Professional Staff Congress in two (2) six-month installments. The Delegate Assembly, by majority vote, may review and deny the extension on a case by case basis at any time during the course of that year.
 
Proposal 2: Allow members to restart their full membership rights and benefits up to a year after being separated from CUNY and then rehired.
 
Thank you for your engagement.
 
In solidarity,
 
Nivedita
