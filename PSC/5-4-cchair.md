Dear CSI Community,
 
I hope this finds everyone safe and healthy!  Although it has been some time since my last communication, the chapter EC has been diligently involved with numerous efforts to be in direct communication with our administration supporting, protecting and advocating for all our members.  We are inviting the campus community to participate in a Zoom chapter meeting tomorrow, Tuesday, May 5 at 2:30 pm.  Once you scroll down you will see the link for the Zoom meeting.  The Chapter EC has another labor-management meeting scheduled for this Friday, May 8 and we are hoping our chapter Zoom tomorrow can help inform and guide us as we prepare the agenda for that meeting.
 
These are challenging times on multiple fronts.  The entire campus is desperately waiting to get details about the summer and fall semesters and how we will prepare for them.  There are numerous issues that are directly related to all the titles under the union umbrella.  The President's message over the weekend outlined three core principles moving forward: "maintain quality instruction for our students; minimize cuts to staffing to the greatest extent possible; and maintain a safe and healthy campus, for the day we are able to return to normal operations."  In my weekly exchanges with chapter chairs across CUNY, I can share with you that every chapter chair and the chapter EC's are I sincerely hope committed to doing all we can to support and advocate for all our members.  But in many ways, this is no different than every other semester previously.  We always do all we can to assure everyone has their jobs, have their health insurance to the greatest extent possible, and we have always advocated for a safe and healthy workplace,
 
But the New York State budget is challenging to say the least.  We are all being tested and now is the time for all of us to communicate and work together to make sure our students receive a quality eduction.  I sincerely hope you, or a designee, can join our Zoom chapter meeting tomorrow at 2:30 pm.  It is very important we hear from you!!!
 
In closing I want to deeply thank everyone for all their incredible work and service during this pandemic.  This crisis has touched all of us in ways none of us imagined a few months back.  We have students, staff and faculty who have all been affected by COVID-19 in one form or another.  in name of the chapter EC, our condolences go out or anyone who has suffered a loss to a family member of friend.  Besides all the logistical matters we need to address, I hope we can acknowledge that we are all feeling the trauma and grief of this pandemic, and we are still in this crisis.  As expressed early on, we are ALL in this together and we thank you all for responding so compassionately to the unforeseen challenges we have all had to face.
 
Take extra good care of yourselves and yours loved ones,
