To the CSI Chapter,

I hope this finds everyone safe and healthy!!!

First, the administrationâ€™s demand to cut the adjuncts by 35% did not come to pass.  We wish to commend the department chairs for their resistance to comply with this demand and for their support of our adjuncts as vital members of our teaching faculty.

Second, this is a reminder that our chapter will be holding a Zoom Town Hall this Thursday, May 14 from 2:30-4:30.  The Town Hall will focus on how we can address the threat of proposed budgetary cuts to our college, and CUNY in general.  We will send out a Zoom link by tomorrow afternoon.

We look forward to having as many of you involved as possible!

Wishing everyone health and safety!
