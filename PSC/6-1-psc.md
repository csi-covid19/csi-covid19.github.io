Dear CSI Chapter,

We hope this finds everyone safe and healthy!!!

We first want to thank everyone for participating in our last Chapter meeting, Tuesday, June 9!  We had a great turnout and we are thrilled we are about to embark on important and significant union work and activities for the summer.  Our next chapter meeting will be next Monday, June 22 at 2:30. The Zoom link for the meeting is right here and please register before 2:00 pm next Monday.

After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

This meeting is very important as we will be confirming our chapter volunteers for numerous groups who will have focused areas or activities to work on this summer.  At the close of our meeting on June 9th, we did get many of you to volunteer for different activities or groups.  We have all those listed and will be prepared to share all those next Monday.  But we hope we can get more of you to volunteer and join with us as we continue our work this summer.

In addition to our chapter meeting next Monday, there will also be a PSC action next Tuesday, June 23rd at 5 pm.  We will create a human chain between the CUNY offices on East 42nd Street and Governor Cuomo's office on 41st and 3rd Avenue.  We need as many members to kick off our summer actions to register your support and involvement.  Please go to this link to register:
