Dear colleague:

The New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (NYCOSH) is offering "COVID-19: Worker Safety & Health" online workshops via Zoom. The information on this week's workshops and how to register is below. This is a workshop that may be especially useful for anyone who is deemed essential staff, but may be useful to anyone who is looking for information on basic health and safety practices related to COVID-19 and related protections for workers under OSHA standards and guidelines. These workshops tend to last about 2 hours. Please feel free to pass this information to colleagues.
