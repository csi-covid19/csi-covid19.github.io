Good morning CSI!

Here we are Day 20 since the Governor announced the suspension of in-classroom teaching!  Again, I hope all our community are safe and healthy!!  We are all experiencing a life-changing pandemic and I sincerely hope you are able to cope and sustain yourselves while living and working from home round the clock!  I just have two things to share.

First, I am forwarding you a message from the PSC about online workshops from the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Healthy regarding COVID-19.

Second, the chapter executive committee is scheduled to hold a labor-management meeting this coming Thursday, April 2 at 11:30 am.  Please pass along any of your questions and concerns so we can present them to President Fritz.

Please stay inside as much as possible.  Work remotely but work well!  Remember by working remotely and taking care of ourselves, and washing hands, we take care of each other!!!

Dear colleague:

The New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (NYCOSH) is offering "COVID-19: Worker Safety & Health" online workshops via Zoom. The information on this week's workshops and how to register is below. This is a workshop that may be especially useful for anyone who is deemed essential staff, but may be useful to anyone who is looking for information on basic health and safety practices related to COVID-19 and related protections for workers under OSHA standards and guidelines. These workshops tend to last about 2 hours. Please feel free to pass this information to colleagues.
