<p>Dear Faculty and Staff:</p>
<p>As you know, in-person Commencement ceremonies are not being held due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are still optimistic that we might be able to hold a physical ceremony in the fall, and we will keep you posted as we learn more about the reopening of New York State.   We know that having a traditional ceremony would mean a lot to you, our students, and their families, and we will do our best to make it happen – if we can do it safely.  </p>
<p>Although Commencement is postponed, many students requested caps and gowns for their personal celebrations or portraits.  Purchase information may be found on the CSI Commencement webpage.</p>
<p>Many students have also asked about diplomas.  We are pleased to announce that we can mail diplomas to our June and August graduates.  More information regarding when graduates may expect their diplomas in the mail will be forthcoming, including how to access a free PDF version.  For those who received their degrees in January, we are currently working on getting their diplomas to them. </p>
<p>Please know that we are excited to honor our graduates.  Beginning May 26, 2020, we are going to start celebrating our graduates.  Please follow CSI on Facebook, Instagram, and/or Twitter to see our social media campaign.  We will also list the names of candidates for graduation on the CSI Commencement webpage and in the Staten Island Advance &#40;special June edition&#41;.</p>
<p>Finally, we will be releasing a Salute to the Class of 2020 video on May 28, 2020.  CSI created this video to share our messages of congratulations and best wishes, including special messages from President William J. Fritz and the outgoing Student Government President and Class of 2020 graduate, Fatu Amara.</p>
<p>We know this is not the way our students planned to end their collegiate experience, and we understand their disappointment.  However, we will have a Commencement celebration in the fall, and we look forward to giving our students the sendoff they deserve.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jennifer S Borrero, J.D. Vice President for Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement     ​</p>
