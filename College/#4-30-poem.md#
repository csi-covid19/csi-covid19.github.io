Dear Students, 

If you have been writing, drawing, photographing, or expressing your emotions in regard to your experience of the last two months, please consider being part of the Poetic Pandemic Project.
 
The Poetic Pandemic Project:
The purpose of this project is to collect students' poems or other forms of written or visual expression at this time to document how students at CSI experience the current pandemic.
 
Process:
Professors Deborah De Simone, Gail Rosenberg, and Marta Cabral of the School of Education will collect and read/view submissions of poetry, prose, or other forms of written expression as well as submissions of collage, photography, painting, drawing, or other forms of visual expression.
 
The professors will select those pieces they feel that best express the diversity and power of experiences had by our student community. Excessive profanity is to be avoided. Hate speech of any kind will not be accepted.
 
The final selections will be complied and published. Although this project is designed for internal use, distribution to a wider audience and publication may be considered in the future. 
 
Guidelines for Submission:
All submissions are to be sent to Professor De Simone at: deborah.desimone@csi.cuny.edu. 
By submitting a piece to Professor De Simone, the author gives permission to Professors De Simone, Rosenberg, and Cabral to publish that piece in any form or venue.
