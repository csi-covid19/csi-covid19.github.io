Hello Faculty Center Hub Participants,

A quick update to let you all know that Blackboard Collaborate sessions have been limited to 250 participants per session.

If anyone needs a larger session (up to 500), please let CSI Blackboard Administrator, Michael Castelli know by emailing him at michael.castelli@csi.cuny.edu so he can coordinate with CUNY Central.

Thank You.

The Faculty Center Team
