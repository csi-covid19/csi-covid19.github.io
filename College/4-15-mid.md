Dear Colleagues -
 
Last Friday, all course instructors received an invitation to take part in MID-SEMESTER PROGRESS REPORTS to assist us with outreach to students.  To date, we have an 11% response rate identifying 953 students at-risk or in need of outreach.  It is important that you complete these reports, so that we can connect students to the resources they need to successfully complete the semester.  Likewise, your report will help us gauge the scope of student academic needs at this challenging time.  If you have not submitted your reports, please take a few minutes to complete these as soon as possible.
 
These emails went to the preferred email accounts indicated in CUNYfirst. If you have not received a progress report request, please send an email to StudentSuccess@csi.cuny.edu and, if necessary, update your account information in CUNYfirst. 
 
Thank you for helping us help your students.
 
J Michael Parrish
Provost, Senior Vice Presidentâ€‹ for Academic Affairs
