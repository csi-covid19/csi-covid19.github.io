All:

Information from CUNY regarding faculty office hours, teaching observations, annual evaluations, and promotion/tenure processes under our current telecommuting situations. More information should be forthcoming in the near future.

Distance Learning and Contractual Obligations:  The following guidance is in response to questions pertaining to faculty office hours, classroom observations, annual evaluations, and the reappointment, tenure, and promotion process.  This guidance is based on consultation with several provosts and in discussion with the Professional Staff Congress at a recent labor management meeting with the Chancellor and his executive team. For more information, contact: Pamela Silverblatt, pamela.silverblatt@cuny.edu
Both full-time faculty and adjuncts who are responsible for, and paid for, office hours will hold office hours through distance technology and will notify their students and their department chair regarding how they plan to hold the hours.  These notifications should be made on or before Friday, March 27.
Classroom teaching observations that have not yet been conducted during the Spring 2020 semester, will only be conducted if requested by the employee to be evaluated.  The department may use the new protocol for observations in online settings (Article 18.2(b)3), where the course was changed to a distance modality mid-semester, provided the employee is made aware and has the option to proceed with the observation.  Teaching observations for those who have been teaching online since the start of the semester, and who were otherwise contemplated to be observed pursuant to the new provision in Article 18.2(b)3 for online observations, will have their observations conducted.
Annual evaluations which include the conference and confirming memorandum will have the conference conducted through distance technology, which may include telephone and/or videoconferencing.
Decisions on tenure, promotion, reclassification and discretionary assignment salary differentials that are currently in process shall be completed.
Faculty and staff shall be permitted to retrieve personal belongings and materials needed to work remotely
