Dear Faculty and Staff:

Dear Colleagues;

We are writing as a follow-up to the Chancellor’s message. Over the last week and through the weekend Administration has been working with Central and stakeholders to prepare for the transition for telecommuting for the majority of staff with minimal staff reporting to the campus, as well as addressing health and welfare issues related to the campus.

We are still developing procedures for all of our work titles and appreciate your patience and cooperation as we finalize plans to continue providing instruction in a way that is sensitive to the needs and concerns of all of our employees.  We will be providing guidance to Directors on how to manage and coordinate work with those employees who will be working remotely within their Department.  Employees will be expected to perform their essential functions when telecommuting and offices will be expected to continue to provide essential services to students, faculty and staff in a timely manner.  Human Resources will be available to assist Directors with any questions to help ensure a smooth transition.  We expect to be providing additional updates later today and/or tomorrow.

Thank you all for the work you have done, are doing, and will continue to do in support of our students, each other, and the College.

​Sincerely,

Jessica Collura
Director of Employ
