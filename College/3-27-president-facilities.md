To the Campus Community:

Consistent with my recent video message, we have been making arrangements for Dolphin Cove and the Recreational Center to be used by the State in their efforts to stem the tide of the spread of COVID-19 and in support of our Island community. As Governor Cuomo noted in todayâ€™s press conference, the College has been designated a Phase B location. I will provide additional information as it becomes available, including when a date for use of Dolphin Cove and the Recreational Center is finalized.

Sincerely,

William J. Fritz
President
