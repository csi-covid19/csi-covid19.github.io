Dear CSI Students,

We hope that this message finds you well during this trying time. The Office of Student Life would like to remind you that the CSI Food Pantry remains an available resource.

If you or a student you know is having difficulties finding food to eat during this challenging time, CSI has a non-perishable Food Pantry that was created to help provide assistance for our students .  At this time, the pantry remains available to our Campus Community by appointment only.  

The Food Pantry appointment hours will be from 10:30am – 1:00pm on Wednesdays and Fridays.  If you need to make an appointment, please fill out the link below and someone from the Office of Student Life will contact you.  
Please note, if the dates and times listed above do not work for your schedule or if you have any questions, please feel free to email us at studentlife@csi.cuny.edu.

In light of ongoing developments around COVID-19, some emergency food providers have temporarily suspended normal operations and have switched to “grab and go” meals and pantry bags to minimize the risk of exposure. Many others, however remain open and this website will help you find pantries near your home address.  

Plentiful App: https://www.plentifulapp.com/ Plentiful is a free app that you can download to locate pantries in your neighborhood. As the ongoing developments around COVID-19 are changing rapidly, please be sure to confirm hours of operation by calling before you visit.
