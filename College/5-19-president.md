To the Campus Community,
 
I am pleased to announce that the CUNY Board of Trustees has approved the appointment of Hope Berte as CSIâ€™s Vice President for Campus Planning, Facilities Management and Operations. I want to thank Provost Michael Parrish for chairing the search committee and all of the committee members for their hard work.
 
Ms. Berte has been a dedicated and valuable member of the College of Staten Island since April 2006. She has consistently received roles of increased responsibility, as evidenced through her career progression at CSI having served as the Associate Director for Human Resources, the Director of Human Resources, the Executive Director Human Resources & Labor Designee, the Deputy to the President/Chief of Staff and since July 2018, the Interim Vice President for Campus Planning, Facilities Management and Operations. Ms. Berte holds a Master of Science in Business Management and Leadership from CUNY School of Professional Studies, and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Brooklyn College
 
The appointment of Ms. Berte as Vice President for Campus Planning, Facilities Management and Operations will ensure that the College of Staten Island continues to have the critical leadership and oversight of the essential operations of the College and continue to focus on making the College a destination campus.
 
Please join me in congratulating Hope.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
William J. Fritz
President
