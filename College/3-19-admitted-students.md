Dear Colleagues,

In accordance with CUNYâ€™s directive to limit non-essential public gatherings and NYS guidelines, the March Admitted Student Conferences has been canceled.

The Office of Recruitment and Admissions is developing various options for our prospective students who wish to learn more about our college.  This includes on-line options and virtual events that provide much of the content we were eager to share at the Conference.  This will include:
Increased promotion of our existing virtual tour so that students can see our campus, featured facilities and Dolphin Cove.
A new admitted student webpage featuring special video presentations, webinars, resources and much more for our newly admitted class.
Our new closed Facebook group for Fall 2020 admitted students so that they can interact with each other and have questions answered by New Student Mentors (peers).

In dealing with this challenge, there is opportunity to provide more information to our prospects using the virtual platforms.  Perhaps your department was unable to attend the Admitted Student Conference or conduct a session.  Now you have the opportunity to create a video or host a webinar at your convenience.  I encourage you to reach out to me if you are interested in exploring these options.
