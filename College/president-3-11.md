I write to update you on the status of our preparation in response to the coronavirus and the resulting disease, Covid-19.



First, I want to thank everyone for their cooperation and understanding during a stressful time. The health and well-being of our campus community continues to be my number one concern. My second concern is protecting the integrity of the academic term.



Consistent with the Chancellorâ€™s message, we will be taking a pause in instruction from tomorrow, March 12, through March 18. Starting March 19, we will be moving to distance learning for the rest of the semester.



The College is not closing and we will be open tomorrow (Thursday, March 12) through the rest of the semester. Staff are expected to report for work tomorrow (March 12) as normal. Faculty should feel free to come to campus to prepare for remote learning. Students will have full access to facilities. We will use the time from now through March 18 to prepare for distance learning for the rest of the semester. The rest of the academic calendar will remain unchanged.



I know that many questions remain and we will be providing additional information as it becomes available.



This will be a challenging semester and I thank you for your help in ensuring that our students have a successful academic year.



William J. Fritz

President
