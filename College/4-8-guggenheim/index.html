<p>rom: Provost Sent: Friday, April 10, 2020 3:14 PM To: FacultyStaffBroadcast Subject: Some Positive News</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
<p>As we approach the end of our truncated spring break, I want to take the opportunity to share some good news for a change. Yesterday we learned that Dr. Valerie Trevere of the Department of Media Culture was recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for a collaborative project with Dr. Angel Navarez of the New School. They are among the 175 awardees selected from a field of over 3000 applicants for this prestigious award. This quote from the pair&#39;s website &#40;neveraztevere.info&#41; describes their multidisciplinary work:</p>
<p>Tevere and Nevarez “are multidisciplinary artists whose projects and research investigate contemporary music and sound, the electromagnetic spectrum, dissent, and public fora. Their interests lie in the formation of itinerant, performative, and discursive-based social spaces with works that move between the spatial simultaneity of performance and enunciation, reflecting upon political agency through lyrics, audio, and transmission.”</p>
<p>The pair described their Guggenheim project, tentatively titled, A Slow Dropping, as follows: a dispersed musical score, roving from house to house, then sonically assembling in a centralized physical location and an FM broadcast. The musical score will be generated as a site-specific work, where the source of each sound is located in the area of its production. Each musician’s home will become a musical track and personal story coalescing into a unified score, simultaneously fragmented and cohesive, echoing both the social organization of neighborhoods and the mechanics of a recording studio’s mixing board, where individual sound tracks combine to form a field of sonic assembly. A solo exhibition featuring this new project will be presented at the UNO St. Claude Gallery and is curated by Anna Mecugni, Assistant Professor of Art History at the University of New Orleans.</p>
<p>In this era of social distancing, where so many performing artists are limited to performing solo in their homes, this exciting project seems particularly apropos. </p>
<p>​COVID-19 has severely impacted the way we all live our daily lives, and one of our History faculty, Dr. Susan Smith-Peter, is leading a team who are taking the opportunity to chronicle an oral and visual history of the pandemic locally in real time. She and her partners in this project have established a Facebook site: CSI Public History Coronavirus Chronicle to solicit and display news and visual artifacts related to our current health and social crisis. </p>
<p>As we move into April, students are starting to hear about their admissions into postgraduate programs. Political Science Chair, Professor, and Pre-Law Advisor Michael Paris is starting to hear once again that his efforts in mentoring prospective law students are once again bearing fruit. Two of his charges, Kaetlyn Goetten and Jake Haymes, have each been accepted to multiple top-tier law schools with full tuition and/or generous financial support. </p>
<p>Finally, Chazanoff School of Business Dean Susan Holak reports that two of their graduates are doing their part to support those affected by the COVID-19 Crisis. Kevin Ferger, a 2019 Marketing graduate, has started a Go Fund Me campaign to 3-D print masks that he will donate to area hospitals. 2015 Marketing Grad Jonathan Saquisilli has created a Volunteer Marketing Clinic which will provide business owners in the Food and Beverage and non-profit sectors free counseling on the use of things like social media, search image optimization, and email to keep their businesses running during a time when such businesses are facing unprecedented challenges. </p>
<p>It is a pleasure to share some really exciting and positive news,  and I wish all of you a safe and enjoyable weekend.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Michael</p>
<p>Michael Parrish Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>
