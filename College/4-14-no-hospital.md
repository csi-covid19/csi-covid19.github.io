Subject: Hospital plans cancelled at the present time

To the Campus Community,

Yesterday, we were advised that at the present time New York State will not be proceeding with plans to convert the Recreation Center and parking lot 6  to a hospital facility. This is good news which is consistent with reports of improving numbers related to COVID infections.

As you all know, the situation is fluid and I will inform you should the situation change.

I continue to keep you all in my thoughts during this time.

Sincerely,

William J. Fritz
President
