Dear CSI Students:

We hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe during these challenging and uncertain times.

If you are facing an economic emergency, CSI has a grant from the Carroll and Milton Petrie Foundation and may be able to assist you.

This emergency grant fund was created for the purpose of providing quick response emergency grants to matriculated students in good standing to enable them to remain in school, rather than being forced to take a leave of absence or drop out.

Students who demonstrate need and are facing a current unexpected emergency may apply for this grant. All grants are subject to approval with documentation and verification to support your application. Visit the website for more information and to access the application:  https://www.csi.cuny.edu/admissions/paying-college/emergency-funding

Best wishes for continued good health.

Sincerely,

Danielle Dimitrov, Esq.
Interim Executive Director of Student Services
Division of Student Affairs â€‹
