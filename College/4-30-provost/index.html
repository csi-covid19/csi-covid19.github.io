<h2>4/30  email</h2>
<p>Dear Faculty,</p>
<p>As you know, on March 30, the Board of Trustees approved the University’s Special COVID-19 Flexible Grading Policy. This policy was enacted per the recommendation of the Office of Academic Affairs &#40;OAA&#41; and informed by consultation with campus presidents and deans, the University Faculty Senate, and the University Student Senate.  </p>
<p>The Flexible Grading Policy was enacted to provide students maximum flexibility as they navigate the challenges associated with the University’s move to distance learning and the effects of our City’s social distancing guidelines on their personal lives. Please understand that all students have the ability to opt in to utilize this policy for any and all of their CUNY courses, including undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral courses, with the exceptions of the CUNY School of Law and the CUNY School of Medicine. It is obligatory that all colleges adhere to this new grading policy.</p>
<p>A faculty member does not award a CR/NC grade to the student. CR/NC is a choice that students will make in CUNYfirst after they have seen the letter grades that they have earned. Please be aware that our students are instructed to partake in a rigorous advisement process regarding the new grading policy; therefore, they will be making an informed decision when choosing whether to opt in or not. </p>
<p>Specific guidance for all CUNY faculty on the CR/NC Policy is found here​. In addition, I strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with the policy and read over the FAQs, which are updated frequently and posted on the CUNY Coronavirus Update site. </p>
<p>As always, I thank you for your perseverance, flexibility, and commitment to your students’ academic success during this challenging time. </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael</p>
<p>Michael Parrish, Provost and Senior VP for Academic Affairs College of Staten Island
