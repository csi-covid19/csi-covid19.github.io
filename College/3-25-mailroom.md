Dear Faculty and Staff:

As Essential Personnel continue to be needed on campus to serve students and perform tasks that cannot be accomplished remotely, you may need the services of the CSI Mailroom and Receiving Department.  The table below provides our revised hours and procedures.

Please note that contacting these departments one business day before you plan to come to the campus will facilitate our effectively coordinating pick-ups and deliveries to your office. If you plan to come to the campus and are in a position to receive mail or goods on behalf of others in your department, contacting the Mailroom or Operations for deliveries will also allow us to better manage our storage capacity.

Thank you.
