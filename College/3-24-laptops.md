3/24 Rumor ....

----

It is **rumored** that here are many laptops/tablets arriving to CUNY that will be distributed. The logistics of who will get them, how they'll be distributed and managed, etc. is being worked out now at CUNY and at CSI. If you know students, staff or faculty that need equipment, there will be a request form that will go out soon. Students will have first priority.
