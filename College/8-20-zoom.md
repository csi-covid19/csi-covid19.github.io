Subject: Zoom Availability
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
I am pleased to inform you that Zoom is now available. CUNY is currently working on documentation, which I will provide as soon as it is available. In the interim, the following instructions will provide access.
 
Simply go to https://cuny.zoom.us and choose Sign in. You should be taken to the familiar CUNY login prompt where you enter your Firstname.LastnameNN@login.cuny.edu login credentials.
 
Information Technology will also be offering Zoom workshops. Please visit our training calendar to register.
