All:

The changes in academic calendar created by the Recalibration period and the shortened spring break had implications for religious observations for a number of you. I would like to remind those of you whose religious observation extends into the week of April 13 that, as always, you have the right to request a religious exemption from academic and work responsibilities.CUNY’s guidance for religious exemptions can be found here.

Sincerely

Michael Parrish, Provost and Senior VP for Academic Affairs​
