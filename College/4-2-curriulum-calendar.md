Hi Curriculum Chairs,
 
I have revised the Curriculum Committee Calendar.
 
Each of you are now Leaders in the Curriculum Organization on Blackboard.  From what I remember when I set this up, all Faculty should have access to this site. 
 
I have created “meetings” in collaborate for each of the remaining dates for this semester. I am new to this – so if we don’t separate entries for each meeting, rather just three for the committees, please let me know.
 
For College Council/Faculty Senate – if we intend on using BlackBoard for those meetings please let me know and I will create/add.
 
Thanks, 
Veronica
