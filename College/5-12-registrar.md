Dear Faculty,
 
As you know, the Spring 2020 term is coming to an end. Final exams will begin on May 15, 2020 and the term will officially end on Friday, May 22, 2020. 
We write to inform you that grade rosters for the Spring 2020 semester are now open and visible in CUNYfirst through the faculty self-service menu.
 
Attached are instructions on how to enter your grades in CUNYfirst, along the CSI grading symbols and clarification on when to assign D, F, INC, and WU grades. I encourage you to review the attached document and, if you have any questions or concerns, to contact Associate Registrar, Juline Robinson at juline.robinson@csi.cuny.edu for assistance and guidance.
 
Important:
Once you have entered all the grades, you must change the Approval Status from the drop-down menu from ‘SAVE BUT NOT SUBMIT to ’SUBMIT GRADES TO REGISTRAR’. The POST button will appear at the bottom right hand side of the page and clicking the POST button will make the grades official and immediately available to the students.
 
Grades are due 48 hours after final exams are administered.  Grades for all courses, including independent study sections, must be posted in CUNYfirst by Thursday, May 28, 2020 at 11:59pm. 
 
The Registrar’s Office understands it has been a challenging semester for us all, but we strongly urge you to comply with the deadline for submission of your final grades. 
 
Submitting grades on time will give our students the necessary opportunity to consult with their advisors before making their final decisions of opting-in to the Credit/No Credit grading option available in Spring 2020.  Additionally, entering grades on time will prevent delays in conferral of degrees, degree verification for employers, enrollment for the Fall semester, and the completion of the Satisfactory Academic Progress determination for financial aid and the academic standing calculations.
 
Best regards,
Office of the Registrar
