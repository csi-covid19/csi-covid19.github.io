To all:                               

The stress of the COVID 19 pandemic, its economic fallout and stay-at-home mandates could lead to excess drinking or marijuana use.  Curious to self-assess your own use?

Available FREE to all students, eCHECKUP TO GO is a confidential online self-assessment program for alcohol and marijuana.
 
SIMPLE TO ACCESS: Go to the CSI H&W eCheckUp To Go webpage and start your own assessment.
 
This program may also be used to earn PG CLUE credit, completely online, anywhere, anytime!
