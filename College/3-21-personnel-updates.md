Dear All;

Keeping in line with the executive order issued yesterday by Governor Cuomo, effective Sunday, March 22, 2020, at 8:00 pm, all employees will be working remotely except essential employees in the following areas:

Facilities
Public Safety
Animal Research Facilities
Dolphin Cove
Childcare Centers (for 1st responders)
Food Pantry (by appointment)
Dining Services (for residents only)

Thus, as of 8:00 pm, Sunday, there will be no on-campus services for any other departments.  All departments will be providing services remotely, during regularly scheduled business hours, until further notice.  Information Technology will be available to respond to campus in the event of an emergency.

Our first priority is the health and safety our students, faculty and staff.  We are committed to providing the best customer service possible while working remotely.

We hope that you and your loved ones stay healthy and safe.

Sincerely,

Jessica Collura
Director of Employee Relations
& Labor Designee
