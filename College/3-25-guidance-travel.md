All:

Please review this guidance from CUNY Academic Affairs regarding current restrictions on travel:


Prospective Academic and Business Travel (Faculty, Students, and Staff): All non-essential university-related international and domestic travel is indefinitely suspended at this time, this includes the suspension of all Spring 2020 and Summer 2020 study abroad programs. It also includes all CUNY-sponsored student international travel (including spring break), non-CUNY credit-bearing programs, and non-credit travel under the auspices of CUNY or any CUNY college or student organization.  Please know that credits earned on non-CUNY study abroad programs this summer will not be accepted by the University.

Requests for exceptions to this policy will continue to be reviewed by the Office of Global Education and Initiatives and the Office of Risk, Audit and Compliance, but will also be elevated to the Executive Vice Chancellor and University Provost, who will make a final recommendation to the Chancellor after consideration of any national and local travelrestrictions, as well as guidance established by local health authorities and the CDC for New York and the traveldestination to limit the risk of exposure and unintended geographic spread of COVID-19.

Offices supporting group travel should continue to submit Trip Proposals and provide risk management reporting as usual.

Planning For and Returning from Personal Travel: The Department of Stateâ€™s Global Health Advisory (issued March 19, 2020) warns that a shutdown of international travel options is imminent, and that Americans abroad should arrange to immediately return to the U.S., or risk an indefinite stay abroad.  In order to help CUNY students return home before it is too late, CUNY will continue to offer rebooking support to any CUNY student or employee abroad (regardless of citizenship) who is unable to make these arrangements directly with the airline.  Individuals should contact evac-support@cuny.edu with details on their CUNY affiliation (including EMPLID if possible) to receive instructions on accessing this support.
