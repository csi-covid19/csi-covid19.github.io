We have received requests for information on reported cases of COVID-19 at the College.  As of today, Human Resources has received 16 positive reports of COVID-19 from faculty and staff.   Regrettably, 1 of these 16 cases resulted in death. Please keep in mind that some of these reports are presumed positives as not everyone received a test confirming the medical diagnosis. This number only includes those who have self reported their illness. There is always a possibility that there are other cases which have not been reported.
 
In the unfortunate event of the death of a member of the community, we seek permission of the family to announce their passing.  We will only make such announcements if the family consents.
 
It is our sincere hope is that you and your loved ones are well and stay safe.
 
We will continue to provide periodic updates.
 
Thank you!  Be well,
 
Human Resources
