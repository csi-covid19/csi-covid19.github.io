Dear CSI Faculty,
 
We would like to take a brief moment during this challenging time to let you know that we are now processing book orders for 2020 summer and fall courses.
 
By placing your summer and fall book orders now, you are ensuring timely delivery while also helping us to provide affordable options for students such as used books, rental books, eTextbooks, and loose-leaf editions.
 
As the safety of students continues to be a priority for us, we will be offering free shipping on online orders for the foreseeable future. Books and other material can be delivered directly to students’ residences.
 
To order books for your summer and fall courses, please do so at www.facultyenlight.com. You can contact the CSI Bookstore manager, Nicole Kempster, at nicole.kempster@csi.cuny.edu if you have any questions or concerns. 
 
Thank you and be safe!​
