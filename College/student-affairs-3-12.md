Campus leaders are continually monitoring the situation in coordination with CUNY and state officials, which includes a cross-campus task force working every day to ensure CSI is responding with the utmost abundance of caution.

CSI is continuously monitoring the COVID-19 situation and will keep you updated as much as possible to maintain the health and wellbeing of our community.  Visit this site for the most up-to-date and reliable campus information.
