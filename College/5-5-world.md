To our CSI College Community,
 
While the events of this term have required that we move away from our traditional campus-based formats and engage in more remote forms of learning and sharing, we should not turn away from the pressing global issues that remain present.  Our World on Wednesday lecture series was designed to bring a glimpse of the larger global environment to all of us at CSI.  The spring 2020 series continued as planned but were delivered via recordings in an online format.  Many of you have had the opportunity to watch these lectures already but we wanted to ensure that you still had the chance to see them again, or for the first time.
 
As such, we are delighted to announce the Spring 2020 World on Wednesday (WOW) Lecture Series featuring faculty and staff from across the campus are now all archived online and you can view these your leisure until the end of August 2020.
