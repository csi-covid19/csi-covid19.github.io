Dear CSI Students:

I hope you and your families are safe as we all manage the new realities caused by the Coronavirus pandemic.  I understand there is enormous uncertainty at this time and I recognize the anxiety this has caused many of you. 

To help address your concerns, I invite you to join me in a virtual Student Town Hall where you will have an opportunity to ask me questions. This Student Town Hall will be held on Wednesday, April 1, 2020 at 3:00 p.m. Instructions for joining are at the bottom of this email. This is the first of a few events that we are planning throughout the spring semester to help you succeed. 

Student Town Hall Meeting Rules:

​​Participant questions should pertain to their experiences with the College since in-person instruction ended on March 11, 2020.
All participants will be muted upon entering the town hall.​ 
All questions should be typed in the chat.  
Chat discussion and questions will only be viewable by the host(s). 
Questions will be answered in the order they are received.  
Dependent on time not all questions may be answered.  
This town hall will be recorded. 
This is a Double CLUE ( 1PG and 1CC). If you want credit for the CLUE, please include your emplid in the chat question (you can do this even if you don’t have a question.)
