Subject: Move to Online Instruction for Summer 2020

Dear Colleagues,



Given the uncertainty surrounding the duration of the current health crisis, we have made the difficult decision to move all Summer 2020 instruction online. We are currently finalizing the revised coding of all courses for the summer term in CUNYfirst prior to the opening of registration this Wednesday, April 1st. This decision is being implemented now so that students and faculty can all be prepared in advance for online instruction, rather than making a last-minute transition.



If there are any courses your department currently has listed for Summer 2020 that cannot be offered in an online format, please contact us as soon as possible via email to schedule@jjay.cuny.edu to have those courses removed from the summer schedule.



As we move forward, please let us know if there is any information or other support we can provide. We will be in direct contact with departments that may have more specific concerns.



Best regards,

Brian Cortijo
