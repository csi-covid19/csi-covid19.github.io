Tomorrow, at 10am, there will be a meeting for the international students only. This is specifically for students to give them a forum and address their concerns.

 

For EOs, APOs, and faculty, an additional meeting has been scheduled at 1pm tomorrow -- to address questions regarding the new and troubling announcement from SEVP on International Students that has caused much confusion and anxiety. 

 

The link to the 1pm meeting is below.
