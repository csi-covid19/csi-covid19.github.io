STATEMENT FROM CHANCELLOR FÉLIX V. MATOS RODRÍGUEZ 
ON RULE CHANGES REQUIRING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO TAKE IN-PERSON CLASSES
 
“The City University of New York decries a federal rule change announced Monday that could force hundreds of thousands of international students to leave the U.S. in the fall. As modified by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the rules governing the Student Exchange and Visitor Program will require students who are in the U.S. with an F-1 visa to take at least one in-person course. With the high probability that the coronavirus pandemic will continue to make distance learning the predominant mode of instruction at colleges across the country, the rule change means that most of the estimated 1.1 million international students will be forced out of the country in September.  
 
“This misguided policy change also threatens to hurt higher education at a time when the nation’s universities are working hard to adjust to the dual health and economic crises caused by the pandemic. We are once again disappointed that our country’s leadership continues to restrict and reduce opportunities for those who seek them in the United States.
 
“CUNY campuses have thousands of international students whose status is threatened by the new rule. These students are a valuable and a vital part of our community.  I have instructed my administration to explore and pursue measures that would help these students remain in the country and continue their education at CUNY. We will also be joining forces with other universities and national organizations to further support those affected by these restrictions and pursue all viable legal remedies to humanize these rules.”
