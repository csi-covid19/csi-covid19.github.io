At the request of University Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs Annemarie Nichols-Grinenko, I forward the links below.

 

There is a new "Faculty Related Academic Continuity Guidance" page on the Faculty Affairs website. This new page includes information from the EVC's Academic Continuity Updates that is most relevant to faculty, as well as other important information (e.g., links to accessibility resources, as suggested by several FAAB members) that we hope will help faculty. The direct link to the page is https://www.cuny.edu/academics/faculty-affairs/faculty-related-academic-continuity-guidance/

 

There is also a prominent link to the page on the CUNY Faculty Affairs homepage, which you can find at https://www.cuny.edu/academics/faculty-affairs/

 

Please share this with your colleagues.

 

Please note: this page is a work in progress and will be updated as Executive Vice Chancellor Jose Luis Cruz sends out new Academic Continuity Updates and as we receive requests from faculty for additional information. As these updates occur I shall pass along the information accordingly.
