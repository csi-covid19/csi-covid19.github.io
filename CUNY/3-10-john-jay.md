TO: The John Jay College Community



RE: Coronavirus Update–College is Closed Tomorrow, Wednesday March 11



I am writing to inform you that we learned late today that a member of our John Jay community has tested positive for the coronavirus. The student is safely at home recovering under medical guidance, and our thoughts are with her and her family for a speedy recovery. Because the student was on campus only Thursday evening for one class last week and did not develop symptoms until Saturday, we have been advised by State health officials that the risk to our community is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, the school will be closed tomorrow, Wednesday, March 11.

We will use the day tomorrow to consult further with public health and state and city officials. We will contact directly the other students in her class and their instructor to make them aware and answer any questions they may have. In the meantime, all on-campus classes are suspended tomorrow, but any fully online courses will proceed as scheduled. Unless otherwise notified, all students, faculty, staff, and visitors should not come to any of the College’s campus buildings tomorrow, March 11.



What You Should Know Now

·       If You’re Sick: As always, if you feel sick, please contact your health provider. If you feel you can’t afford or are otherwise unable to seek care, please call 311. You should know that hospital staff cannot ask you about your immigration status or deny you care based on your ability to pay.  If you come into contact with someone who is known to have been exposed to the coronavirus or just tested positive, please contact Malaine Clarke at 212-621-4101 or maclarke@jjay.cuny.edu.



·       Cleaning & Disinfecting Campus: Because we have been proactive in our efforts to minimize risk to our community from this virus, by coincidence, the Facilities Department dispatched additional staff to perform a thorough cleaning of the campus on Sunday, March 7. This was in addition to our practice of routine environmental cleaning for all restrooms and high-touch surfaces in common areas during the week.



·       Prepare for Remote Classes: Faculty should spend the day tomorrow preparing for the event that their courses may need to be moved online for distance learning. Faculty can review the resources that have been shared and posted on the College website to assist with the process of translating their courses to distance learning.  The Department of Online Education and Support and the Teaching and Learning Center will also continue to post resources here.



Please continue to visit the CUNY website and John Jay’s College website for the latest updates, information, and resources, and I will continue to update the community as we receive new information.

During these uncertain times, I am grateful for the care and concern that you have shown for your fellow community members, as well as to those who are the most vulnerable among us and in our communities. At a time like this, we are truly one community where everyone is committed to working together and taking care of each other.





Thank you,
