<p>Present:  Provost  Parrish,  AVP  Serrano, Chief  of Staff Wallace;  Professor&#39;s Cumiskey,  Milligan,  Sanchez,   Verzani; Higher   Education Officer  DeMeglio</p>
<h1 id="review_of_3rd_quarter_financial_report_of_cuny"><a href="#review_of_3rd_quarter_financial_report_of_cuny" class="header-anchor">Review of 3rd  quarter  financial report of cuny </a></h1>
<p>https://csi-covid19.github.io/CUNY/6-9-FY2020.pdf</p>
<p>As  for CSI,  our projected year  end balance is 19K; heading into the year our  balance was  13k. The expenditures and  resources are essentially the same.</p>
<p>The projected revenue over tuition target is -1.8M, a bit better than  our  mid-year position; better than last year&#39;s ending  position &#40;though there was a signifcant adjustment to this year&#39;s target so that  comparison is not   a  straight comparison.&#41; The college was on  track to make a dent in this, as collections had improved as of February. It was noted that some campuses  &#40;notably KBCC&#41;  had a huge negative change  in this  category  post March.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we heard non-tax  levy  resources are   severely challenged, though no numbers were discussed &#40;Auxiliary, </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...&#41;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We don&#39;t know if  there  is any unencumbered OTPS; close out isn&#39;t  completed until  September, typically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The June 30  end of budget year  means trying to get purchases done and delivered  by that date.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fy21_budget"><a href="#fy21_budget" class="header-anchor">FY21 budget</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Historically, the college would be notified of its initial allocation by the end of June.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At CUNY&#39;s Admin Council there was notice that there is currently  no allocation numbers known. These will likely be known the 1st or 2nd week of July</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#40;NYS may  make another adjustment to its revenue projections by  June 30th. At the last opportunity, end of April, the April 1 budget was  to be modified by  ~10B for state  agencies. Presumably, CUNY is waiting for that decision. Meanwhile, the state is waiting the outcome of the HEROS act, which promises 35B for the state...&#41;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While at  one point, colleges  were  alerted to prepare for a 10&#37; reduction, it is currently working on a contingency  of a 3&#37; reduction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We  reviewed  several reductions &#40;real and  possible&#41;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The campus based  allocation is ~110M</p>
</li>
<li><p>While campus based expenditures would typically go up 5&#37;, the initial NYS budget for CUNY showed only a ~2&#37; increase,  pending a tuition increase &#40;this  is a 3&#37; reduction&#41;. &#40;The reserve was used to  pay prioir year&#39;s contractual increases, but going forward this must come from the campus-based resources.&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>the tuition increase may not  pass the board. This is roughly a  2&#37; reduction</p>
</li>
<li><p>the state budget <strong>may</strong> ask for 10&#37; reductions, </p>
</li>
<li><p>the enrollment picture <strong>appears</strong> to be heded to a 5&#37; reduction, Every 1.25&#37; drop is about a 1&#37; reduction in campus based resources; so that would be a ~4&#37;  reduction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cares_act"><a href="#cares_act" class="header-anchor">Cares  ACT</a></h1>
<p>The cares act  brought students  at CSI ~6.3M &#40;mostly allocated&#41;</p>
<p>The CARES act brings CSI ~ 6.3M for covid related expenses &#40;response to and planning for&#41;. This money has not come to campus; There is an addition 900k, with similar restrictions, coming as we are a hispanic serving institution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It was suggested that  some of this  money could  pay for creative teaching &#40;the equivalent of having  TAs  in large lectures&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is uncertain how fungible these funds will prove to be</p>
</li>
<li><p>There was a sentiment expressed that FEMA funds may   be more certain</p>
</li>
<li><p>There was a chicken-and-egg problem mentioned: we don&#39;t have funds to spend so that we can get reimbursed</p>
</li>
<li><p>To that, the question of whether endowment funds could be used for purchases was raised. In <em>general</em> these funds have restrictions on the amount spent per year so that the capital is preserved &#40;e.g., CUNY&#39;s investment fund lowered their cap recently to 3.75&#37;, down from 4.25&#37;&#41;. The specific details  of the case of the 7M Business School endowment were not discussed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the college has asked departments to submit logs on expenses, and use special codes for CUNY  First</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to a question about the cost of  delays, we heard:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>work with subcommittees to track quantities</p>
</li>
<li><p>CARES money is one-shot money</p>
</li>
<li><p>figure out how to leverage it</p>
</li>
<li><p>can&#39;t afford everything </p>
</li>
<li><p>gather supplies, materials and phase it</p>
</li>
<li><p>IT/Facilities investments</p>
</li>
<li><p>can we sustain:  Example: <em>if</em> we have to provide face masks for 1200 people, 1 per  day, for one semester this is around 100k</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ca_positions"><a href="#ca_positions" class="header-anchor">CA positions</a></h1>
<p>We heard that the following was shared with P&amp;B: <strong>contingency</strong> plans for bad scenarios include 3M reduction in the CA budget. &#40;Emphasize, this is part of a plan and may not come to pass&#41;. &#40;3M in CAs is <em>about</em> 200 1020-hour lines&#41;.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It was pointed out that P&amp;B is not a wide enough venue for this discussionn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It was noted  that several creative ideas could be discussed, but aren&#39;t being due to the forums for dscussion  &#40;an emphasis on the P&amp;B&#41;.</p>
</li>
