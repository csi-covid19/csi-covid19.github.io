A. The proposed reduction in compensation outlined in Item II.5 and II.6 of the October 2018 memorandum should not be adopted, nor should any similar workload-related policy change, until proper consultation with faculty governance has taken place.

B. “Proper consultation with faculty governance” should be defined as, minimally, consultation with the Executive Committees of Faculty Senate and College Council. In matters likely to have a direct impact on faculty research, we also recommend engaging the Research Committee.
