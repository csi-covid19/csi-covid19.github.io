# Chair's report 5/21

A lot is happening, here in chronological order:

## May  5th

the  day  of Governor [Cuomo's](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-collaboration-gates-foundation-develop?fbclid=IwAR1mYQLxxMwthMWtijBPSdEIMUHyH9d69XsRZbGCeuWCgiwaW0W-spo1HV0%E2%80%8B) statement on reimagining education, The College Council  Executive  Committee met with President Fritz and Provost Parrish. Our agenda included:

* The Budget:

And a proposal to create a  task force/committee to address a potentially devastating budget position

Reimbursals:  We would like to discuss how the college can leverage this expectation to provide satisfactory work environments for staff and faculty.

* Keep all aspects in focus:

At the FS Town Hall, the topic of support for research was raised. Historic cuts to the support of research were  reviewed, but a  conversation on  supporting the research  infrastructure during troubling times ahead is required.

At the HEO Town  Hall,  the topic of training of  HEO staff  was raised by many staff members. It was felt the focus has been on faculty and students, and the real needs of HEO training have  been overlooked.


* F20 scheduling.


During  the meeting we reviewed several uncertainties in the budget, such as the state allocations to CUNY, CUNY's  campus-based  allocations;  CARES monies; hispanic  serving institution monies;  a  pot of CARES  money  for K-16 at  the governor's  direction, etc.


----

Notably,  no  discussion on an upcoming May  9th memo to CSI Chairs regarding severe  adjunct budget cuts. At some point around this  time the  Chancellory notified the colleges to expect a 10% reduction in tax levy resources. The proposed adjunct  budget cut **likely** was in response to that.

##  May 6th

College Council and Faculty Senate Executive Committee sent a  [letter](https://csi-covid19.github.io/CCFS/ccfs-letter-may-6.pdf) to the President and Provost regarding the college response to the pending budgetary crisis


## May 9th 

[Email](https://csi-covid19.github.io/CCFS/5-9-president) from president in response:

I have given your letter serious consideration and must respectfully decline implementation of this approach.

[Email](https://csi-covid19.github.io/CCFS/5-9-CC-chair-response) from the College Council Chair to the President 


 The plan proposed by the College Council and Faculty Senate gave a mechanism and a foundation to give the campus meaningful input into the campus response, which due to the scale, must be widespread. Now you have personally assumed ownership of the process, its results, and the inevitable fallout.

[Memo to chairs](https://csi-covid19.github.io/College/5-9-provost-adjuncts/) 
 
 Carlos Serrano has provided each Dean with financial targets that show the dollar amounts that would correspond to a 35% cut within each school/division. The Deans have discretion to provide for variation within departments, but each school/division should aim to meet the specified targets for Fall 2020.


## May 12th

5/12:  [Email](https://csi-covid19.github.io/College/5-12-president/)  from President on the budget

we are exploring various budget scenarios. ...  I and my administrative team will continue to communicate and consult with these as well.


Since that day, I have been involved in discussions at the IPC  and the Budget Committee. I believe it accurate to say that I have not heard any specific additional detail on further budget  reductions from the administration, though the  IPC  die  hear  very detailed   reports  on the costs  of  research  and  the costs  of instruction and the budget committee was solicited  for ideas on  savings  areas.

If you allow me some personal thoughts, let's hope **now** that the president isn't  *forced* to  convene a committee.

I call the following scenario the perfect storm -- it is a "worst  case scenario": a 10% reduction to *total* budget (~16M, ~11M of tax levy); a 10% drop in enrollment  (~8M); no tuition increase (~ 3M); **and** limited federal support beyond the already implemented CARES act (at most  ~ +7M).  In that case, cutting the adjunct budget 35% (of ~17M) is just a baby step, and the concern shifts to **retrenchment**.


Following the board policy on [retrenchment](http://policy.cuny.edu/policyimport/manual_of_general_policy/article_v_faculty,_staff_and_administration/policy_5.19_retrenchment/document.pdf), 

> the President of each affected College shall convene an ad hoc College-wide Committee, the members of which shall be designated by  the President and shall include representatives of appropriate constituent groups including the College-wide Personnel and Budget Committee,2 other teaching and non-teaching members of the instructional staff, including those currently serving as  members of existing College bodies, members of the classified staff, students, the Affirmative Action Officer, and administrators of the College.

>  Plans for "The discontinuance of instructional staff personnel shall be implemented as a last resort only after the pursuit of other less drastic means to alleviate the impact of a financial exigency."

Discussing these "less drastic means" was the point of our request.

Let's not forget the *potential* gravity of the  situation. The last time CUNY faced 
such perilous budget times was 1975 and let's review what happened in the aftermath:


* FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD
* Faculty walked a picket line; faculty were furloughed and lost several weeks pay
* Tuition was  imposed for the first time on CUNY students
* The board of Higher Eucation was replaced by the politically appointed Board of Trustees
* CUNY was censured by the AAUP for how it eliminated lines, including  tenured faculty
* The shotgun wedding of SICC and Richmond college formed the College of Staten Island.

Will the budget crisis this time fracture the college beyond recognition?

**If** the worst case scenarios are  realized, and  the  college fails  to identify  and 
protect its  essential  missions this is an all to real possibility.

Let's just take for example, the first shot over the bow: an
"**exercise**" to cut 35% of the adjunct budget (to  save  4.8M). To implement this
**and** have full enrollment requires ~30% more students per section on
average, and much more for many multi-section  courses. It is a plan that can't
possibly work in the on-campus setting and would expose dramatically that fact  that
personalized online education does not scale.

That's a radical change to how the college operates, and that drastic
a change only gets a start -- at most -- to the goal line in a perfect
storm.

As for other less drastic means, I have yet to hear of contingency
plans by the college beyond this, but you can be sure the next areas
that **would** be announced come from the temporary personnel budget
are: College Assistants, Graduate Assistants,  and research infrastructure  (animal lab facility, HPCC,...)

Should this storm come to pass, this will all happen during the
summer.  Usually shared governance takes a bit of a rest during the summer, but this
summer  will certainly be different.
