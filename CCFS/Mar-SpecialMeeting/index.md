## Anonymously posting to Teams

Dear College Community, As mentioned in the special session of the College Council held on March 11th, 2021, should you wish to post to TEAMS *anonymously*, feel free to send an email to [jverzani@gmail.com](jverzani@gmail.com). I am happy to post for you. As a governance leader I am well aware that many in the community might feel intimidated by speaking your feelings about a proposal the President is personally supporting.
