# Budget Committee

The budet committee met on March 16, 2021. We discussed many important things. The followin

* CUNY's BOT will be voting soon on a budget for the current fiscal year. The resolution includes:

- FY2020 adjustments to our base budget of 1.7M (enrollment related); and a state cut of 1.7M (~ 2%, not the feared 20%).
- a financial plan submitted by 3/31

* For the latter, we reviewed several dollar numbers that comprise a plan including:

- Reductions of about 2M in (FT) Personnel due to the hiring freeze (no detailed headcount was known, but will be known in May)
- plans for paying the 2% contractual raises by the close of this fiscal year
- reduction in temporary personnel including adjuncts. (Some saving in non-reappointments; some savings in adjunct costs, though not as large as targeted).
- reduction in OTPS expenses including suspension of several key contracts (transportation, some maintenance, and water cooler)

* We discussed the CARES money, the second half is listed in resources (~3M) but not yet released; the MSI monies, the second and third federal monies not listed in resources (I might have the MSI detail incorrect). 

(Not part of this year's plan is the ~16M that will be available through CRRSSA (sp?) and the ~22.5M + 2.5M through the new federal act.)

All told, the net is a -2.6M balance for the financial plan.
