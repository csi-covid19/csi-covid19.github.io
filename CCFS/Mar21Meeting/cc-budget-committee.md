# Budget Committee

The budet committee met on March 16, 2021. We discussed many important things. The following is an attempt to capture the conversation, but the numbers were jotted down. Corrections are welcome.

* CUNY's BOT will be voting soon on a budget for the current fiscal year. The resolution includes:

- FY2020 adjustments to our base budget of 1.7M (enrollment related); and a state cut of 1.7M (~ 2%, not the feared 20%).
- a financial plan submitted by 3/31

* For the latter, we reviewed several dollar numbers that comprise a plan including:

- Reductions of about 2M in (FT) Personnel due to the hiring freeze (no detailed headcount was known, but will be known in May)
- plans for paying the 2% contractual raises by the close of this fiscal year
- reduction in temporary personnel including adjuncts. (Some saving in non-reappointments; some savings in adjunct costs, though not as large as targeted).
- reduction in OTPS expenses including suspension of several key contracts (transportation, some maintenance, and water cooler)

* We discussed the CARES money, the second half is listed in resources (~3M) but not yet released; the MSI monies, the second and third federal monies not listed in resources (I might have the MSI detail incorrect). 

(Not part of this year's plan is the ~16M that will be available through CRRSSA (sp?) and the ~22.5M + 2.5M through the new federal act.)

All told, the net is a -2.6M balance for the financial plan.

* The meeting followed with a conversation of many suggestions by committee members Professor Milligan and Professor Cumiskey.
