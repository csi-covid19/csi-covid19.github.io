<p>The State of New York directed that the public universities mandate COVID vaccinations for students, upon the federal government’s full approval of the vaccine. To that end, the Board of Trustees passed a resolution delegating the implementation of the mandatory vaccination policy to the Chancellor. The Chancellor’s draft policy has been distributed to campuses and will be finalized after the campus comment period.</p>

<h4 id="cuny__2"><a href="#cuny__2" class="header-anchor">CUNY</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>People who are not fully vaccinated and those who might need to take extra precautions must wear a mask indoors at all times. Unvaccinated members of the CUNY community &#40;students, staff, faculty, visitors, etc.&#41; will be asked to observe the honor system in complying with this requirement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Acceptable face coverings are required for all unvaccinated individuals who are over the age of two and able to medically tolerate such coverings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Acceptable face coverings for COVID-19 prevention include but are not limited to cloth- based face coverings &#40;e.g. homemade sewn, quick cut, bandana&#41;, surgical masks, N95 respirators, and face shields that cover both the mouth and nose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>However, cloth, disposable, or other homemade face coverings are not acceptable for workplace activities that typically require a higher degree of personal protective equipment &#40;PPE&#41; due to the nature of the work. For those activities, N95 respirators or other PPE used under existing industry standards must continue to be used, as is defined in accordance with OSHA guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Campuses will have an adequate supply of face coverings, masks and other required PPE on hand should an employee need a replacement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="suny__2"><a href="#suny__2" class="header-anchor">SUNY</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Pursuant to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &#40;CDC&#41; guidelines, fully vaccinated individuals &#40;i.e. students , faculty, and staff &#41; are not required to maintain social distancing or wear masks, while unvaccinated individuals are responsible for continuing to wear a mask and practice social distancing in all locations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Campus discretion. Campuses may impose additional mask wearing requirements and additional terms or restrictions within the instructional setting &#40;e.g. no eating or drinking&#41; above and beyond the CDC guidance.</p>

<h4 id="cuny__3"><a href="#cuny__3" class="header-anchor">CUNY</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>CUNY will implement surveillance testing for unvaccinated individuals, who will be required to submit a test every 7 days. Continued access to on-campus activities will be contingent on regular submission of a negative test.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fully vaccinated people with no COVID-19-like symptoms and no known exposure will be exempted from routine screening testing programs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Based on CDC guidance, CUNY will stop entry screening &#40;Everbridge self-reporting&#41; and rely on individuals to stay home when they are sick.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="suny__3"><a href="#suny__3" class="header-anchor">SUNY</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Daily health screenings are no longer required for vaccinated individuals. Campuses may continue to screen all individuals for &#40;1&#41; COVID-19 symptoms, &#40;2&#41; recent close contacts, and &#40;3&#41; recent positive COVID-19 test result, regardless of individual vaccination status.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The goal is to get every individual vaccinated. Until that point, mandatory weekly testing will continue to be required for any person4 who has a physical presence on campus and who has not been fully vaccinated or who has not shown proof of vaccination.</p>

<h4 id="cuny__4"><a href="#cuny__4" class="header-anchor">CUNY</a></h4>
<p>For the vast majority of students who are expected to be vaccinated by Fall 2021, physical distancing will not be a required safety measure for classroom and educational settings. People who are not fully vaccinated should continue to practice physical distancing.</p>
<h4 id="suny__4"><a href="#suny__4" class="header-anchor">SUNY</a></h4>
<p>Pursuant to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &#40;CDC&#41; guidelines, fully vaccinated individuals &#40;i.e. students , faculty, and staff &#41; are not required to maintain social distancing or wear masks, while unvaccinated individuals are responsible for continuing to wear a mask and practice social distancing in all locations.</p>

<h4 id="cuny__5"><a href="#cuny__5" class="header-anchor">CUNY</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Campuses must conduct regular cleaning and disinfection of the facilities and more frequent cleaning and disinfection for high risk areas used by many individuals and for frequently touched surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whenever possible, campuses will increase ventilation of outdoor air &#40;e.g., opening windows and doors&#41; while maintaining safety precautions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="suny__5"><a href="#suny__5" class="header-anchor">SUNY</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The New York State mandatory cleaning and disinfection protocols are no longer in effect. However, it is highly recommended that campuses clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as common areas and shared workstations, at least once a day and regularly clean and disinfect other surfaces as necessary given the level of traffic and type of individuals who use the space and general risk of community transmission of COVID-19. Campuses must provide hand hygiene stations or supplies within workplaces for individuals to use; specifically, hand washing, such as soap, running water or disposable towels or hand sanitizing, such as alcohol-based sanitizer with 60 percent or more alcohol where hand washing may not be available or practical.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Campuses should increase outdoor airflow and ventilation rates in indoor settings to the extent compatible with individual comfort and safety and in accordance with building codes and standards, as well as applicable lease, contract, or other use agreement requirements; in indoor areas where air is recirculated, should consider higher rated filtration within HVAC systems as supported by the filter rack and air handling system so long as the system can perform to the level of heating and cooling that it was able to provide prior to the COVID-19 public health emergency; and consider other appropriate indoor air quality measures, such as portable fans, filters, and air cleaners.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>CUNY will continue to require that unvaccinated individuals enter quarantine in the event of possible exposure, and isolation should be required for all individuals when diagnosed with COVID-19. Unless showing symptoms of COVID-19, vaccinated individuals do not need to quarantine in the event of possible exposure to someone who has a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="suny__6"><a href="#suny__6" class="header-anchor">SUNY</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Campuses should plan to maintain a reasonable portion of the rooms previously held or have access to space off campus for quarantine and isolation uses. The CDC Guidance indicates that fully vaccinated individuals who are exposed to COVID-19 do not have to quarantine unless they are symptomatic. Fully vaccinated individuals who test positive must isolate for 10 days.</p>
