### Board action (As of July 6th, 2021)

On July 6th, the CUNY Board approved a vaccination policy for the F21 semester.

> From the FAQ:

> 2. Am I required to be fully vaccinated to attend school?
>
>**All Students** registering for a **fully in-person** or **hybrid** class for the 2021 Fall Term **must be fully vaccinated** in order to access University Facilities and Programs, unless they have been granted an Exception or Medical Exemption (as defined in the Policy) and submitted a Form to the Location Vaccine Authority.

Students can register for such classes, but must show proof of vaccination two weeks prior to coming to campus, but no later than August 10, 2021.

Some informal notes from a CUNY Central town hall on June 22nd. Please note these "policies" may not be implemented at CUNY Central or at the campuses as plans evolve. Understand them for now as aspirational:

* 50% office capacity on any given day
* Vaccine will not be mandated for faculty, staff or guests until NYS mandates all employees to do so
* Masks are required indoors for all non- and not-completely vaccinated – the honor system will monitor this and these individuals are encouraged to wear masks.
* PPE is available
* Testing will be frequent for employees and verified/implemented via “Excelsior Pass & other sources”
* Everbridge will be used

### New York State relaxes COVID-19 restriction (as of June 15, 2021)

> Unvaccinated individuals continue to be responsible for wearing masks, in accordance with federal CDC guidance. Consistent with the State's implementation of the recent CDC guidance, masks are still required for unvaccinated individuals. Further, the State's health guidelines continue to be in effect for large-scale indoor event venues, pre-K to grade 12 schools, public transit, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and health care settings per CDC guidelines.
