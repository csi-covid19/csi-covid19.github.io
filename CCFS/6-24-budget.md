# Review of 3rd  quarter  financial report of cuny 

https://csi-covid19.github.io/CUNY/6-9-FY2020.pdf

As  for CSI,  our projected year  end balance is 19K; heading into the year our  balance was  13k. The expenditures and  resources are essentially the same.

The projected revenue over tuition target is -1.8M, a bit better than  our  mid-year position; better than last year's ending  position (though there was a signifcant adjustment to this year's target so that  comparison is not   a  straight comparison.) The college was on  track to make a dent in this, as collections had improved as of February. It was noted that some campuses  (notably KBCC)  had a huge negative change  in this  category  post March.

*  we heard non-tax  levy  resources are   severely challenged, though no numbers were discussed (Auxiliary, 
...)
* We don't know if  there  is any unencumbered OTPS; close out isn't  completed until  September, typically.
* The June 30  end of budget year  means trying to get purchases done and delivered  by that date.

# FY21 budget

* Historically, the college would be notified of its initial allocation by the end of June.
* At CUNY's Admin Council there was notice that there is currently  no allocation numbers known. These will likely be known the 1st or 2nd week of July

(NYS may  make another adjustment to its revenue projections by  June 30th. At the last opportunity, end of April, the April 1 budget was  to be modified by  ~10B for state  agencies. Presumably, CUNY is waiting for that decision. Meanwhile, the state is waiting the outcome of the HEROS act, which promises 35B for the state...)

* While at  one point, colleges  were  alerted to prepare for a 10% reduction, it is currently working on a contingency  of a 3% reduction.

We  reviewed  several reductions (real and  possible)

- The campus based  allocation is ~110M
- While campus based expenditures would typically go up 5%, the initial NYS budget for CUNY showed only a ~2% increase,  pending a tuition increase (this  is a 3% reduction). (The reserve was used to  pay prioir year's contractual increases, but going forward this must come from the campus-based resources.)
- the tuition increase may not  pass the board. This is roughly a  2% reduction
- the state budget **may** ask for 10% reductions, 
- the enrollment picture **appears** to be heded to a 5% reduction, Every 1.25% drop is about a 1% reduction in campus based resources; so that would be a ~4%  reduction

#  Cares  ACT

The cares act  brought students  at CSI ~6.3M (mostly allocated)

The CARES act brings CSI ~ 6.3M for covid related expenses (response to and planning for). This money has not come to campus; There is an addition 900k, with similar restrictions, coming as we are a hispanic serving institution.

* It was suggested that  some of this  money could  pay for creative teaching (the equivalent of having  TAs  in large lectures).

* It is uncertain how fungible these funds will prove to be

* There was a sentiment expressed that FEMA funds may   be more certain

* There was a chicken-and-egg problem mentioned: we don't have funds to spend so that we can get reimbursed

* To that, the question of whether endowment funds could be used for purchases was raised. In *general* these funds have restrictions on the amount spent per year so that the capital is preserved (e.g., CUNY's investment fund lowered their cap recently to 3.75%, down from 4.25%). The specific details  of the case of the 7M Business School endowment were not discussed.

* the college has asked departments to submit logs on expenses, and use special codes for CUNY  First

In response to a question about the cost of  delays, we heard:
- work with subcommittees to track quantities
- CARES money is one-shot money
- figure out how to leverage it
- can't afford everything 
- gather supplies, materials and phase it
- IT/Facilities investments
- can we sustain:
   Example: *if* we have to provide face masks for 1200 people, 1 per  day, for one semester this is around 100k


# CA positions

We heard that the following was shared with P&B: **contingency** plans
for bad scenarios include 3M reduction in the CA budget. (Emphasize,
this is part of a plan and may not come to pass). (3M in CAs is
*about* 200 1020-hour lines).

* It was pointed out that P&B is not a wide enough venue for this discussionn.
* It was noted  that several creative ideas could be discussed, but aren't being due to the forums for dscussion  (an emphasis on the P&B).
