Dear Colleagues, 
 
I write to update you on the activities of the UFS Research Foundation Faculty Advisory Council (RF-FAC). 
 
I call your attention to [minutes](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/831i5rd7rbyts07/AAAnBeguAcDRD59B3a_kn7u5a?dl=0) from meetings of the council, and several service incident reports brought to the attention of the leadership of the CUNY RF.  
 
Of note is [analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhqnub9cpz6y6k5/19-120619-CUNY-UFS-RF-FAC-2018-Beta-RF-Survey-Analysis-Rev-061320.pdf?dl=0) of the 2018 Opinion Survey conducted by the Beta Corporation in the Spring of 2018.  I also provide the [spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/29ixw317jcccvx7/19-120619e-CUNY-UFS-RF-FAC-2018-Beta-RF-Survey-Raw-Data-Analysis.xlsx?dl=0), which includes the raw data, used in the analysis.   Both the service incident reports and the analysis of the survey have been discussed with the leadership of the CUNY-RF; we await their responses. 
 
Please continue to bring issues with the service provided by the CUNY RF to the attention of the Faculty Advisory Council.  
 
Thank you.   I hope that you are having a relaxing and productive summer.    Best,  -David
