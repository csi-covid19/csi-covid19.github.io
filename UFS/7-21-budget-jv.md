# Adopted City Budget

The city adopted a budget in a timely manner for the upcoming fiscal year. The University provides an analysis.
It should end up [here](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/budget-and-finance/), but not yet. It can be found [here](https://csi-covid19.github.io/CUNY/fy2021-city-budget.pdf).



Highlights:

There was a fiscal year 2020 (FY20) adjustment to the monies allocated to the CCs. These include reductions to the CUNY Tutor Corps (2M), the College Visits program (0.9M), and contract spending (1M). (The analysis is relative to the Mayor's executive budget; this budget had mid-year reductions. For the CCs, there was a 13M reduction in reserves in the Q3 report, up from an anticipate 5M reduction.)


For next year, FY21, the college bumps overall funding from 459.9M to 464.6M (1.02%). (511M was requested)

Changes include

* an additional 25.3M in *efficiencies* (totaling 46.3M for FY21). 
* 13.5M in collective bargaining increases
* 11.5M in fringe benefits
* 4.4 for building rentals

At one time, ASAP was to be deffered (to save 54.3M). There was *some* restitution, 34.3K direct funding
restoration to the program and a 20M increase to the Universityâ€™s target for savings efficiencies.

Several items that are threatened but were supported include: Vallone Scholarships (16M), 1M for food insecurity programs, 2.3M for CUNY research institutes, 3M for Citizenship now, 1.2M for new technology...

The 5-year adopted *capital* budget include 636.7M in city funding

There is 43.9M in Reso A funding for FY21. (Borough President funding of projects)




# State budget

The state budget picture is still very uncertain. Around April 1, the state adopted a budget. CUNY's position then looked similar to the year before (increases of around 2% when expenditures increased around 5%).

However, this budget had 3 stop out points (4/30, 6/30, 12/31). Around April 30, the state announced it would likely trim back 8.2B from state agencies of which CUNY is a part (~10%) **provided** no additional federal funding was forthcoming. On June 30, no new adjustments were made.

However, State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli reported recently that tax receipts in June fell 475M *below* the Cuomo administration pandemic-revised forecast.

The state *seems* to be waiting for the federal government to decide if it will add significant additional funds in a HEROES or new CARES act before committing. According to reporting at [www.thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/7/16/21327761/cuomo-aoc-federal-aid-new-york-budget-billionaires-tax?mc_cid=cc7ac511f1&mc_eid=a0a8e88ef)) a state budget is not expected  until September. (Ned will discuss how the university is handling the lack of year-long budget in a budget year that began July 1.)



# Tuition increase/Wellness fee


In the University Budget [request](https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/administration/offices/budget-and-finance/FY2021-CUNY-Budget-Request_2020-02-10_FINAL.pdf), the university requested increased tuition at the senior colleges by \$100 per semester, as it has done for the past several years under the "predictable" tuition policy. This year the university *also* requested the same increase for community college students, which hasn't been the case of late. These increases project to an additional 36M and 16M in resources.

In addition, a \$60/semester wellness fee was proposed.

CUNY was given authority to impose these costs by the state, but *both* are pending board approval. In the normal order, these two increases would have been voted on in June. Neither vote occurred. Whether a vote will finally happen and if it were to happen, whether either would pass is currently uncertain.
