    <hr>


<!-- Content appended here -->
<div class="franklin-content"><h1 id="adopted_city_budget"><a href="#adopted_city_budget">Adopted City Budget</a></h1>
<p>The city adopted a budget in a timely manner for the upcoming fiscal year. The University provides an analysis. It should end up <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/budget-and-finance/">here</a>, but not yet. It can be found <a href="https://csi-covid19.github.io/CUNY/fy2021-city-budget.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<p>There was a fiscal year 2020 &#40;FY20&#41; adjustment to the monies allocated to the CCs. These include reductions to the CUNY Tutor Corps &#40;2M&#41;, the College Visits program &#40;0.9M&#41;, and contract spending &#40;1M&#41;. &#40;The analysis is relative to the Mayor&#39;s executive budget; this budget had mid-year reductions. For the CCs, there was a 13M reduction in reserves in the Q3 report, up from an anticipate 5M reduction.&#41;</p>
<p>For next year, FY21, the college bumps overall funding from 459.9M to 464.6M &#40;1.02&#37;&#41;. &#40;511M was requested&#41;</p>
<p>Changes include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an additional 25.3M in <em>efficiencies</em> &#40;totaling 46.3M for FY21&#41;. </p>
</li>
<li><p>13.5M in collective bargaining increases</p>
</li>
<li><p>11.5M in fringe benefits</p>
</li>
<li><p>4.4 for building rentals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At one time, ASAP was to be deffered &#40;to save 54.3M&#41;. There was <em>some</em> restitution, 34.3K direct funding restoration to the program and a 20M increase to the Universityâ€™s target for savings efficiencies.</p>
<p>Several items that are threatened but were supported include: Vallone Scholarships &#40;16M&#41;, 1M for food insecurity programs, 2.3M for CUNY research institutes, 3M for Citizenship now, 1.2M for new technology...</p>
<p>The 5-year adopted <em>capital</em> budget include 636.7M in city funding</p>
<p>There is 43.9M in Reso A funding for FY21. &#40;Borough President funding of projects&#41;</p>
<h1 id="state_budget"><a href="#state_budget">State budget</a></h1>
<p>The state budget picture is still very uncertain. Around April 1, the state adopted a budget. CUNY&#39;s position then looked similar to the year before &#40;increases of around 2&#37; when expenditures increased around 5&#37;&#41;.</p>
<p>However, this budget had 3 stop out points &#40;4/30, 6/30, 12/31&#41;. Around April 30, the state announced it would likely trim back 8.2B from state agencies of which CUNY is a part &#40;~10&#37;&#41; <strong>provided</strong> no additional federal funding was forthcoming. On June 30, no new adjustments were made.</p>
<p>However, State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli reported recently that tax receipts in June fell 475M <em>below</em> the Cuomo administration pandemic-revised forecast.</p>
<p>The state <em>seems</em> to be waiting for the federal government to decide if it will add significant additional funds in a HEROES or new CARES act before committing. According to reporting at <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/7/16/21327761/cuomo-aoc-federal-aid-new-york-budget-billionaires-tax?mc_cid&#61;cc7ac511f1&amp;mc_eid&#61;a0a8e88ef">www.thecity.nyc</a>&#41; a state budget is not expected  until September. &#40;Ned will discuss how the university is handling the lack of year-long budget in a budget year that began July 1.&#41;</p>
<h1 id="tuition_increasewellness_fee"><a href="#tuition_increasewellness_fee">Tuition increase/Wellness fee</a></h1>
<p>In the University Budget <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/administration/offices/budget-and-finance/FY2021-CUNY-Budget-Request_2020-02-10_FINAL.pdf">request</a>, the university requested increased tuition at the senior colleges by &#36;100 per semester, as it has done for the past several years under the &quot;predictable&quot; tuition policy. This year the university <em>also</em> requested the same increase for community college students, which hasn&#39;t been the case of late. These increases project to an additional 36M and 16M in resources.</p>
<p>In addition, a &#36;60/semester wellness fee was proposed.</p>
<p>CUNY was given authority to impose these costs by the state, but <em>both</em> are pending board approval. In the normal order, these two increases would have been voted on in June. Neither vote occurred. Whether a vote will finally happen and if it were to happen, whether either would pass is currently uncertain.</p>
