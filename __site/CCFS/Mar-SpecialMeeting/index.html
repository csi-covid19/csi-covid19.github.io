<li><p>The Department of Curriculum and Instruction passed this resolution on Monday, March 8th:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolved: The faculty of the Department of Curriculum &amp; Instruction hereby censures President Fritz for the process he has employed to replace the current CSI Governance Plan. Further, the faculty rejects the governance plan he has proposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The Department of Educational Studies </p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We the faculty of the Department of Educational Studies do hereby strongly oppose President Fritz’s unilateral proposal to replace the current CSI Governance Plan.</p>

<li><p>March 16th, 2021 statement by the Department of Performing and Creative Arts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We, the faculty, HEOs and CLT of the Performing and Creative Arts Department, oppose the proposed imposition of changes in governance structures. It is a document in which many proposed changes remain underdeveloped and it fails to detail how they would be implemented; it was created without due process of consultation with faculty and other stakeholders such as the standing By-Laws Committee and without the democratic process of approval by a majority of instructional staff; it diminishes faculty leadership; its abrupt and short timeline provides little opportunity for productive response. Therefore, we reject the proposal issued by the Office of the President on March 3, 2021. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Council of Chairs</strong> voted on this statement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We, the Chairpersons of the academic departments of the College of Staten Island, meeting as the Council of Chairs, object to the process through which the governance proposal has been presented without thorough consultation. We have strong concerns about the diminishment of the faculty role in academic decisions. We recommend a revised timeline that allows for careful consideration of every aspect of this plan and input from an array of stakeholders.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We, the faculty of the Department of the Nursing, object to the proposed governance plan for the College of Staten Island announced by the Office of the President on March 3, 2021, and the process by which it was introduced. This governance proposal has been presented without any consultation. The department of Nursing supports three Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing &#40;ACEN&#41; accredited programs all which mandate active participation in governance.  According to ACEN Standard 1.2 “The governing organization and nursing education unit ensure representation of the nurse administrator and nursing faculty in governance activities; opportunities exist for student representation in governance activities.”  The faculty in the department require additional time to consult with the accrediting organization to determine the implications to our existing accreditation and future candidacy. Furthermore, our graduates’ eligibility to take national licensing exams is predicated on this accreditation. The faculty and the College have a responsibility to make a thorough and measured evaluation of the implications of this proposed governance plan for both the programs and the students whom we serve.</p>

<p>Dear College Community, As mentioned in the special session of the College Council held on March 11th, 2021, should you wish to post to TEAMS <em>anonymously</em>, feel free to send an email to <a href="jverzani@gmail.com">jverzani@gmail.com</a>. I am happy to post for you. As a governance leader I am well aware that many in the community might feel intimidated by speaking your feelings about a proposal the President is personally supporting.</p>
