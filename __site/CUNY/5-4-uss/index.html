<p>5/4 email to  student leaders</p>
<hr />
<p>Good Morning Student leaders,</p>
<p>I hope that this email finds you safe. Below is a list of student support services that should still be open on our campuses or digitally. Please feel free to reach out if there are any discrepancies&#33; Please stay safe&#33;</p>
<p>Registrar – All Campuses are maintaining regular business hours and are available via email, phone, TEAMS, or WebEx  – contact information for all Registrar offices is available on https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/registrar/campuses/ ScheduleBuilder – Launched in Spring 2020, Schedule Builder enables students to plan and register for courses that meet their schedules and other needs.  This application shows courses listed in the University’s course schedule &#40;i.e., CUNYfirst&#41; and allows students to select those courses based on desired time, location, availability and other factors. https://www.cuny.edu/schedulebuilder</p>
<p>Financial Aid -  All Campuses are maintaining regular business hours and are available via email or phone – contact information for all Financial Aid  offices is available on http://www.cuny.edu/financial-aid/information-resources/financial-aid-offices/</p>
<p>Admission -  All Campuses are maintaining regular business hours and are available via email or phone, TEAMS, or WebEx   – contact information and more details about commitment/transfer/virtual tours, for all Admissions offices is available on our new Future Student Enrollment Guide - https://www.cuny.edu/admissions/future-student-guide/</p>
<p>Advising -  All Campuses are maintain regular business hours and are available via email or phone, TEAMS, or WebEx  – contact information for all Advising offices is available on https://www.cuny.edu/advising DegreeWorks Advising Tool - DegreeWorks is a web-based program that enables you to easily track your academic progress. You will be able to see how specific College requirements have been met and what courses you can take to fulfill the requirements which are remaining. With the click of a tab &#40;the ‘What If’ feature&#41;, you will also be able to see how your academic requirements might change if you were to change your major. https://www.cuny.edu/degreeworks DegreeWorks Transfer Tool - Transfer What-If is a DegreeWorks feature that lets students and their advisors see how credits, taken at a CUNY institution, would transfer to another CUNY institution and apply towards a desired area of study. Transfer What-If can make student planning for a transfer between CUNY colleges easier. It also helps advisors to keep students who plan to transfer to a particular program at another CUNY college on track, thus expediting degree completion. https://www.cuny.edu/transferwhatif</p>
<p>Enrollment Services Forms/Document Submissions/Connections – Students are able to submit forms/documents via the new CUNYfirst student center document upload service for Registrar/Financial Aid/Health Services &#40;and by next week for Admission and Bursar&#41;.  Link to all above and move are always up to date on www.cuny.edu/em One more addition that I forgot to add is that since board approval we were able to implement full online PDF transcript ordering integrated with CUNYfirst</p>
