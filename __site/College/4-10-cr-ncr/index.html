<p>&#40;ed.: A draft  is circulating that will clarify more the details. It is currently  under  review and should be adopted next week sometime.&#41;</p>
<p><hr /> Per the Registrar&#39;s Office, please see the revised below: &#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; Dear Colleagues</p>
<p>As you know, CUNY&#39;s Board of Trustees has instituted an option for students taking courses by distance education in the Spring 2020 semester to request either a Pass/Fail or a Credit/No Credit option for grades in any course this semester. The message below, drafted by Registrar Kerri Gerson offers guidance to students considering these options. I know that not all of our departments and faculty agree with this policy, and there are justifiably concerns about how electing these options may impact students in areas eligibility for graduate programs and certifications. Nonetheless, it is a CUNY policy and as such we are bound by it. We are expecting more information from CUNY on these options and how they will impact our students and policies. In the meantime, we can discuss these policies at the next Faculty/Staff town hall, tentatively scheduled during club hours next Thursday, April 16.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Michael Parrish Provost and Senior VP for Academic Affairs &#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;</p>
<p>​​Dear Students,​ ​ The City University of New York&#39;s Board of Trustees has recently approved a flexible grading policy for the spring 2020 semester. ​ You now have the option of choosing Pass/Fail &#40;P/F&#41; until May 14, 2020 for elective courses.  To do this, please fill out the form:  Application for Pass Fail Option ​ Additionally, after final grades for the Spring 2020 semester are posted, you will have the option of choosing Credit/No Credit &#40;CR/NC&#41; for individual graded courses in CUNYfirst until June 25, 2020. If you choose this option, a grade of CR will be awarded for any course you received an A-D in, and a grade of NC will be awarded for any course you received an F in. ​</p>
<p>Here are some important points to consider when making your decision about CR/NC: ​ Once selected, the CR/NC option cannot be reversed. ​Courses taken for a letter grade will continue to be included in the semester and general GPA, while courses taken for a Credit/Non-credit grade will be excluded, just as is the case with such courses taken at a student’s home institution.​  If a student exercises the option of Credit/No Credit, the No Credit &#40;NC&#41; grade will not negatively impact the student’s satisfactory progress toward degree completion. ​ We know that you may have questions regarding the implications of choosing these options, so we will be providing further guidance soon.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please email  CNCSpring@csi.cuny.edu​ </p>
<p>Wishing you all good health,</p>
<p>​​The Office of the Provost/Academic Affairs</p>
<p>​</p>
