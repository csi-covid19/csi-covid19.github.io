<div class="franklin-content"><h2>5/21 email</h2>
<p>All:</p>
<p>In advance of today&#39;s Senate meeting, I wanted to provide some information on how different state agencies and accrediting bodies that regulate​ our programs view the current CUNY Cr/NC policy that has been adopted by the City University of New York.</p>
<p>Accrediting bodies &#40;CCNE and ACEN&#41; do not prescribe any specific grading policy or preclude a program from making a change to pass/fail, but defer to state education and licensing boards. &#40;see ACEN statement below on most recent guidance&#41; The ACEN does not proscribe or prescribe any particular grading policy, admissions/exit examinations, or course requirements and changing these policies is not a substantive change. Per Criterion 3.1, policies for nursing students should be congruent with those of the governing organization as well as the state, when applicable, and are publicly accessible, non-discriminatory, and consistently applied. Differences in program policies should be justified by the end-of-program student learning outcomes and program outcomes. Per Criterion 3.3 Changes in policies, procedures, and program information are clearly and consistently communicated to students in a timely manner. If there is a change in policy, please ensure you have documentation regarding the change being approved &#40;even if only a temporary change&#41; and that students were notified of the change in a timely manner. Please make sure this plan is acceptable to your State Board of Nursing and any other state or accrediting agency that has jurisdiction over your program.  Guidance from NYSED suggests that programs consider the long term implications of pass/fail grading policies on student GPAs for financial aid and for future graduate educational prospects, but do not preclude nursing colleges or programs from enacting pass/fail or other grading policies for spring 2020 The American Association of Colleges of Nursing &#40;AACN&#41; does not take a position on grading policy for spring 2020, but notes in their COVID FAQ document that allowing some courses to transition to pass/fail has been identified as an innovative and compassionate strategy to support academic success and programs, with more than 150 colleges and universities nationally moving to pass/fail for spring 2020. CUNY’s Flexible Grading Policy allows a​ student to progress in a program if they elect a CR grade if they receive a passing grade, although the program will need to define if the student meets the necessary competency and professional standard requirements, as outlined in the Nursing Student Handbook, to successfully pass the required course.<div class="page-foot">
