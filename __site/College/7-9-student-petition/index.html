<p>Students Against CUNY Faculty Layoffs Petition</p>
<p>CSI Students, we deserve better. </p>
<p>Our class sizes are increasing, our professors are losing their jobs, and the quality of our education is at risk.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, thousands of CUNY employees were laid off amid serious budget cuts. At the College of Staten Island, low-paid adjunct faculty and college assistants have faced the brunt of the layoffs–without much notice.</p>
<p>What does this mean for us? </p>
<p>Having fewer teachers means having fewer courses offered and larger class sizes. It means losing trusted mentors and advisors. This dramatically increases the burden on those faculty remaining, both full-time and part-time.</p>
<p>These trends would forecast a continual decrease in enrollment, meaning CSI’s budgetary issues will only get worse. As a result, our choices will be diminished and the quality of our learning will suffer.</p>
<p>Budget cuts and layoffs targeting the most vulnerable employees are unnecessary. To date, neither CUNY’s nor CSI’s central administration has shared detailed budget information showing that these measures are necessary.</p>
<p>CUNY has already laid off nearly 3,000 employees, 422 of whom will lose their health insurance, despite the fact that CUNY received &#36;251 million under the CARES Act.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are undoubtedly the backbone of education at CSI, the ONLY public institution of higher education in the borough.</p>
<p>They bring their passion for teaching and guidance into our lives with little in return.</p>
<p>They are not dispensable, yet, the college’s actions show otherwise. </p>
<p>We, the undersigned, demand that CUNY does not lay off any part-time faculty due to COVID-19 or budgetary issues because it will unduly burden students.</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, demand that class sizes are not increased.</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, demand that our fellow students’ tuitions do not increase because of CUNY’s circumstances.</p>
<p>To protect CUNY is to protect students and the future of New York City. </p>
<p>To sign the petition, input your first and last name, as well as your email address.</p>
