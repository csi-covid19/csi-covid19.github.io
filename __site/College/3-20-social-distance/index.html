<p>Dear CSI Students:</p>
<p>The College of Staten Island and the City University of New York continue to monitor the Coronavirus &#40;COVID-19&#41; pandemic.</p>
<p>As you may be aware, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &#40;CDC&#41;, advises that social distancing is key to helping slow the spread of this virus.  Social distancing refers to avoiding close contact with other individuals in order to avoid catching the virus yourself and to avoid passing it on.  As you should be aware, the NYC Health Department advises that there is generalized community transmission of COVID-19 in New York City, meaning there are cases that have no known link to travel or to another confirmed case, so maintaining social distancing is vital under these conditions.</p>
<p>Thus, your instruction has been moved to distance learning and a significant number of employees are working remotely.  To further promote social distancing, student access to the campus will be extremely limited since we are continuing to reduce the number of people on campus to help slow the spread of this virus.</p>
<p>Students must not come onto campus unless they have a critical need.  The 1L Building will only be open for access to the computer labs on the second floor.  Public Safety will monitor the number of students entering to ensure social distancing.  The Library will provide reference services virtually using our 24/7 chat service. Please use the link below to launch chat, send an email, or schedule a virtual consultation: https://library.csi.cuny.edu/help/ask.</p>
<p>Please be mindful that the Campus Center is open from Monday-Friday between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and on weekends from 11:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.    Again, Public Safety will ensure social distancing so it is only to be used by those individuals who have a critical need to be on campus such as residential students and essential personnel.</p>
<p>Many offices that serve students have moved to a remote format.  A few offices, that must remain open to perform critical functions, will have limited hours.  Once finalized, contact information for all student services offices will be shared with you via email and posted to the College webpage.   In the meantime, College offices continue to actively monitor emails and voicemails.  However, contact via email communication is highly recommended and those emails can be found on the website. If you need assistance, we encourage you to send a detailed email &#40;including your contact number and emplid&#41; so CSI staff or faculty can address your questions efficiently.</p>
<p>Please be assured that we are all working diligently to support your academic progress and we thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>We will continue to send email updates as the College finalizes new contact protocols for various offices.</p>
<p>As always, the Division of Student Affairs is here to help you â€“ please email studentaffairs@csi.cuny.edu.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued patience.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jennifer S. Borrero, J.D. Vice President for Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement</p>
