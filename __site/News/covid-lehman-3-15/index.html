<p>From: &quot;President.Lemons&quot; &lt;President.Lemons@LEHMAN.CUNY.EDU&gt; Date: 3/15/20 10:24 PM &#40;GMT-05:00&#41; To: FACULTY-L@LIST.LEHMAN.EDU Subject: Important COVID-19 Update</p>
<p>Dear Lehman Colleagues,</p>
<p>I’m sorry to disturb you at this late hour, though I expect that by now it’s not much of a surprise. I have two important pieces of information to share with you about College operations tomorrow.</p>
<p>First, you should have received a CUNY alert around 8PM stating that only essential staff are to report to work tomorrow. That alert came in response to the Governor’s afternoon announcement of the Executive Order regarding non-essential personnel not reporting to work tomorrow, and the Mayor’s announcement regarding the closing of the NYC public schools.</p>
<p>In light of the CUNY directive, offices, units and departments will not be open to serve students tomorrow, Monday, March 16. In the morning you will be contacted by your supervisor who will make arrangements for you to continue to deliver essential student services in the safest ways possible. You should remain at home in the morning and you will be contacted by your manager with further instructions. As I emphasized with the students and faculty, we are not on a break, and have to maintain or increase our effort in order for this term to end satisfactorily. I have no doubt that you will.</p>
<p>Second, we learned late today that a Lehman student tested positive for COVID-19. The student’s professors and classmates are now being informed, and we are requesting that they self-isolate for one day while we confer with public health officials tomorrow. All the areas this student entered have already been deep-cleaned.</p>
<p>These are extraordinary times, ones that call for patience and flexibility. I will be back in touch tomorrow as we continue to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Thank you for your patience, understanding and loyalty to Lehman College.</p>
