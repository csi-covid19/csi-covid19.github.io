* [7/28 PSC injuction opposition](/PSC/7-28-psc-injunction.pdf) The university's response in opposition to the PSC.

It includes **hints** as to how the remaining CARES funds will be distributed

> CUNY has received about $251,000,000 of CARES Act funding. (Sapienza Decl., ¶ 17) About $118,000,000 of that funding, was already spent on emergency aid to students, in accordance with the CARES Act regulations. Id.; CARES Act §18004(c). The remaining $132,000,000 may be used for a variety of purposes, with the proviso that CUNY must “to the extent practicable, continue to pay its employees and contractors.” Id.; CARES Act § 18006. The DOE is expected to conduct post-audit reviews, and if it deems something an ineligible expenditure, CUNY will then have a disallowance and have to return funds to the federal government. (Id.)

>Although CUNY has not finalized its plans for those funds in detail, it anticipates, broadly, using them for more direct and indirect aid to students: direct financial aid and counseling to students affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, training and professional development to help faculty and staff adapt to on-line instruction, and laptops for students with limited computer access to instruction. (Sapienza Decl., ¶ 19) All of these initiatives will help CUNY students, who, based on the surveys cited above, are struggling with loss of income, food and housing insecurity, and mental stress as a result. (Id.) These priorities are consistent with guidance institutions have received from DOE on the preferred ways of spending CARES Act. Funding.
