<blockquote>
<p>Cruz told the committee. CUNY is projecting a 16 percent increase in summer enrollment despite classes being entirely online. Cruz said enrollment in the fall could drop by 4.4 percent, but that this projection does not include many campuses that have yet to announce their numbers. While it does expect an overall reduction in enrollment, Cruz said the projection was not as bad as other higher education institutions. CUNY has yet to determine the balance between online and in-person classes for the fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Gotham Gazette previously reported, with budget cuts on the horizon, CUNY is eying a reduction in course offerings, which also means cutting the hours of adjunct professors and continuing education teachers, in some cases to zero. Some campuses are planning course reductions of 25 to 35 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to funding for direct student aid, CUNY has received an additional &#36;118 million in CARES Act funding for campus operations related to the pandemic. When Council Member Barron asked how much of that could go to employees&#39; salaries, including the teaching staff, Sapienza said federal criteria limited the spending to teachers&#39; training related to remote learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It cannot be used just for gap-closing activities or to cover a budget shortfall. There are specific uses that are outlined by the U.S. Department of Education,&quot; he told Barron.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When it came time for her testimony, Bowden disagreed: &quot;The CARES Act also includes a provision for keeping employees on payroll. Employees should be kept on payroll if they receive CARES Act money.&quot;</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we are requesting the following from the Chancellor: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The immediate resignation of President Crew. He should not spend his final year &#40;2020-2021&#41; as a lame duck President who has demonstrated his lack of commitment to the College.</p>
