## News

[5/30 Seton Hall plan to reopen](https://www.app.com/story/news/education/2020/05/27/seton-hall-coronavirus-fall-semester/5264854002/) (Thanks  J. Peters)

> They key question as the coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold, albeit at a slowing pace: How is social distancing going to work at an institution with 10,000 students and 3,000 employees, especially in the classroom?

> The answer is what Seton Hall calls “HyFlex blended approach” to instruction. A percentage of students essentially will videoconference into a classroom. Those who videoconference in might do so by choice or be part of a rotating schedule.

> For example: A class that enrolls 20 students and meets twice per week might have 10 students in the classroom and 10 students videoconferencing in during Tuesday’s meeting, with the groups switching roles on Thursday.

>  “We’ve ordered the technology and we’re in the process of retrofitting all our classrooms,” Nyre said.

> “We’ve mapped out 50% (reduction in capacity), 70% (reduction), and 6-foot social distancing mechanics to see how many students we can put in a classroom,” Nyre said. “No matter what density guidelines the state puts out, we’ll meet them.”

> This approach also provides flexibility for students who’d rather not come to campus at all.
