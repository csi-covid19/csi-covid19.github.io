## College


* [7/9 Student petition against cuts to adjuncts](/College/7-9-student-petition) (thanks to Michael Paris)

> What does this mean for us? 

> Having fewer teachers means having fewer courses offered and larger class sizes. It means losing trusted mentors and advisors. This dramatically increases the burden on those faculty remaining, both full-time and part-time.



## PSC

## CUNY/NYC/NYS

* [7/14 Guidance from CUNY #16](7-14-guidance-16.pdf)

> NEW Guidance on Instructional Modalities and Course Scheduling for Fall 2020

There is much there, including:

> The Flexible Grading Policy was approved by the Board of Trustees exclusively for the Spring 2020 semester in response to the sudden change in instructional modality and the disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the lives of our students, faculty and staff. The policy has not been extended to future terms nor is there an expectation that it will be.

> Per CUNY and PSC’s Memorandum of Agreement, regardless of the mode of instruction, at least once during each academic semester, non-tenured and non-certificated members of the teaching staff shall be observed for a full classroom period. One observation shall take place during any scheduled class, except as specified in Article 18.2 (b) 3 for classes conducted wholly or in part through online technology, during the first ten weeks of the semester. For additional details please refer to the Memorandum of Agreement (linked here).

* [7/13 SUMMARY OF ACTIONS TAKEN AT THE JULY 9, 2020 SPECIAL BOARD MEETING](/CUNY/7-13-disposition.pdf)

Includes modifications to the original resolution on opening up.

## News

* [7/14 NY State AG is suing](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/attorney-general-james-sues-trump-administration-reversal-policy-threatens-deport)

The UFS Chair says about this: The suit that NYS AG James is filing in the Federal courts is one that CUNY and SUNY will be providing information/documentation for. Neither SUNY, as a state agency, nor CUNY, as a state supported entity [sic], are able to sue directly in this matter. Rather it is up to the NYS AG to do so, as she has.

* [7/14 Rutgers Union Response to claims of fiscal emergency](https://www.rutgersaaup.org/here-are-the-facts-about-the-fiscal-emergency/) Thanks to Saadia Toor

> We urge you not to accept management’s scare tactics and anti-worker ploys. Read the new report from the AAUP-AFT University Budget and Priorities Committee for a critical analysis of management’s “emergency” claims and their budgets for the next year. Management is not coming clean about its finances. Rutgers has the money to pay the salaries its contracts oblige it to pay. The university needs to honor its promises instead of pretending it has to take back our wages to balance the budget.
