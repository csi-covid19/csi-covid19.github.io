<p>Dear College Community,</p>
<p>Beginning Thursday, March 19th, the Library will reduce its hours to Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm. The Library will be open to all members of the CUNY community, but will be closed to the public. Anyone entering the building will need to use their ID at the turnstiles or show ID to use the accessibility gate.  In order to limit large gatherings, only the first and second floors will be open to patrons.  Each floor will be limited to 50 patrons who must abide by social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>The Library will provide reference services virtually using our 24/7 chat service. Please use the link below to launch chat, send an email, or schedule a virtual consultation: https://library.csi.cuny.edu/help/ask</p>
<p>The Circulation/Reserves Desk will only be open to loan laptops and scientific calculators for the duration of the semester. Books from the general and reserve stacks will not circulate. We will be working to digitize textbooks in order to provide requested chapters via ILL/Document Delivery.  We also encourage faculty to contact us to see if OER textbooks can be used as an alternative.</p>
<p>Please note: regular loan items are being automatically renewed and fines are going to be waved during this time.</p>
<p>Please bear with us as we get many of these new procedures in place.  Do not hesitate to contact us. The link below indicates the library liaison in your department or who is best to address the subject of your assignment. https://library.csi.cuny.edu/about/subject-librarians</p>
<p>Good luck, and stay safe,</p>
<p>Amy F. Stempler Associate Dean and Chief Librarian</p>
