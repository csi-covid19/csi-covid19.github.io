<li><pre><code>  Last Day to File for Pass/No Credit/Fail Option –For eligible students that meet the requirements of our “Pass/Fail/No Credit Option” policy,&#40;https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/administration/offices/registrar/resources/CUNY-Uniform-Grade-Glossary-and-Guidelines-08012018-1.pdf - Page 5&#41;, the University will move the deadline to Thursday, May 14, 2020. This is the published “Last Day of Classes,” and before final examination week &#40;05/16-05/22&#41;, and also prior to the “End of the Spring Term,” &#40;05/22/2020&#41;. See note below on possible financial aid impact on students.</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#91;Note on Pass/No Credit/Fail Option: Students should consult with their academic and financial aid advisor to confirm if such election will still allow them to count the course towards their major/degree requirements, if credit is earned with a grade of P. In order to receive this grade, a student needs to continue participating in academically related activities, complete all assignments, and take the final exam/culminating experience. If a passing letter grade is earned, the student will receive a grade of ‘P’ and credit for the course with no impact on GPA. If a failing grade is earned &#40;F&#41;, the student will receive a grade of NC/NP which does not affect the GPA. Students must remain in compliance with Federal and State Satisfactory Academic Progress guidelines.&#93;</p>

<p>Extending the deadline to May 14 is not enough. They have to broaden the criteria. As it stands, students can only take one course per term pass/fail, and it can&#39;t be a course required for major, minor, gen ed, or teacher&#39;s ed. It is possible that NYS ed dept need to make a ruling on at least some of that, like the teachers ed. The good thing, as my chair told us, is that we have until May to decide. But it will be most helpful if students can know sooner.</p>
