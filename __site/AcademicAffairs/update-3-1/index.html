<p>To the campus community:</p>
<p>Although there have been no reported cases of the COVID-19 virus at the College of Staten Island, a cross-divisional team has been convened to monitor the progression of the virus and to formulating strategies for maximizing campus health and safety and to ensure student success and maintain operations as the campus is impacted. The first discussion was held on Friday, February 28 with representatives from Academic Affairs, the Health Center, the Center for Global Engagement, Facilities, Public Safety, Student Affairs, IT, Human Resources, the Office of Diversity and Compliance, Campus Housing, Auxiliary Services, and Community and Governmental Relations. This group will continue to monitor the progression of the virus and will continue to convene and issue additional guidance as events unfold.</p>
<p>The City University of New York has released a Coronavirus Guidance Update, which we encourage you to read. It covers topics such as study abroad, returning from travel to China, personal preventative measures, and what to do if you display symptoms. It also provides a number of informative Websites, such as the NY State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control, to learn more about the virus and receive authoritative updates, in an effort to prevent transmission and allay fears.</p>
