<p>o All,</p>
<p>I want to make sure everyone on this thread is aware the PSC has publicly taken the position that all CUNY personnel should be working remotely off campus.  Reduced or staggered work schedules are not enough in this pandemic. Each day we are receiving news of new cases of Coronavirus within CUNY ranks.  Just tonight, the President of Baruch reported that an administrator has tested positive, and was at the college working while he was infected.</p>
<p>While the college appreciates the efforts of the president to alter the work schedules and limit who will be reporting to work, it fails to address the pandemic more fully as to underscore what the Governor and Mayor are insisting, everyone should stay home.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the PSC is advocating for closure of the colleges.  Many CUNY campuses are allowing personnel to work remotely, and several have agreed to close their libraries and allow the library faculty and staffs to work remotely off campus.</p>
<p>In addition, the PSC is expressing full support for our members who choose to remain at home out of concern for their health.  Another confusing element of the email is the definition of “essential personnel.”  Simply allowing directors and managers to decide on their own who needs to report to the college and who doesn’t, is not prudent.  I have heard directly from many members who feel unsafe and at risk to report to work, to travel by mass transit, during this outbreak.</p>
<p>I urge everyone to call on President Fritz to reconsider his plan to cut back on the number of HEO staff, faculty, Gittelsons, CAs and CLTs are to report to the college, and responsibly decide to close the college until further notice.</p>
<p>In solidarity,</p>
<p>george emilio sanchez Chapter Chair</p>
