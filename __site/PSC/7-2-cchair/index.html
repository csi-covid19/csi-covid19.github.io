<div class="franklin-content"><h2>7/2 email</h2>
<p>To the CSI Community,</p>
<p>I am writing to inform everyone we held an important chapter meeting as members all joined different working groups to address numerous campu-wide issues, and to begin the process of initiating various actions, events and campus activities that range from student engagement, developing social media, creating town halls and summer and fall actions open to all our members and the Staten Island community.  The CSI chapter is not sitting idly by as we come together to prioritize the safety, health and jobs of all our members&#33;  Stay tuned as we will be sending out updates and information for all our members to become involved, or to participate, in actions and events that will all proclaim: SAVE JOBS SAVE LIVES SAVE C U N Y&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</p>
<p>The PSC will be sending out information for a major action that will take place on Saturday, July 18 from 11 am to 1 pm.  This will be a car caravan that will take place in four boros, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx&#33;  we&#39;ll be looking for members with cars, bicyclists, or caravan route supporters who can cheer us on as we travel the route.  Please keep an eye out with more detailed information.</p>
<p>Regardless of the dedicated and non-stop work of the PSC, too many adjuncts were given letters of non-reappointment yesterday.  The union has been fighting with CUNY Central to avoid and prevent such decisions.  The PSC is committed to doing all we can to rectify these decisions and to continue to advocate for all our members as we face a dire, and uncertain, future.  As a reminder, CUNY Central signed an agreement with the PSC on May 28th promising openness and access to the college budgets, including information on the CARES Act funds, but they failed to keep their word.  This is why the chapter will be engaging in summer actions throughout the summer as we must stand up against the austerity of the CUNY imagination&#33;</p>
<p>If any adjunct received a letter of non-reappointment, please see the link below from the PSc web site.  We are asking all non-reappointed adjuncts to fill out this form.  It is VERY important for future litigation purposes. https://psc-cuny.org/issues/form/adjunct-notifications-reappointment/</p>
<p>Once you fill this out, also be sure to apply for unemployment&#33;  If you have any questions, contact me at 347-414-2393.</p>
<p>Lastly, tomorrow there will be an action taking place at our sister campus, Brooklyn College.  Please see the information below.  If anyone can support this action, in person or on Zoom, we urge you to do so&#33;</p>
<p>To fight back, the Brooklyn College PSC Chapter and a BC Black Faculty organization have organized an action on Thursday, 7/2 demanding the BC President meet with faculty and staff. If she doesn&#39;t, they will march to her house, 30 minutes from the campus, to deliver their message.</p>
<p>If you know people who live in Brooklyn and can encourage them to attend, please</p>
<p>Flyers are attached. More details and registration is at: https://psc-cuny.org/BklynJuly2RSVP</p>
<p>People can also participate virtually via Zoom: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZErdOyhrT4pEtSqvDRuE_BRw1qFUsJ2yt9V</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be reaching out again very soon&#33;  Take extra good care&#33;</p>
