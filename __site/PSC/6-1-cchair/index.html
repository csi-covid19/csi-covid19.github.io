<h2>6/1 email</h2>
<p>To the CSI Community,</p>
<p>I hope this finds everyone safe and healthy&#33;  This past week has been nightmarish. I sincerely hope people can take care of themselves in the midst of so much violence and trauma.  I am including a link to a letter the PSC has released in response to all the deplorable and challenging events of last week.  I hope you&#39;ll read the letter.</p>
<p>https://psc-cuny.org/issues/psc-statement-murder-george-floyd.</p>
<p>Let me also take this opportunity to share some updates.  First, I hope you all saw how the deadline for the adjunct reappointments has been pushed back to June 30.  This is something you all made happen&#33;  People were sending messages, writing op-eds, participating in car caravans and everyone&#39;s collective efforts were heard by CUNY.  Thanks to all for all you did in this effort.  in regards to the adjunct reappointments, the chapter EC wishes to specifically acknowledge the support and advocacy of all the chairs.</p>
<p>We need to change the date of our next chapter meeting.  We want to meet Tuesday, June 9 at the same time, 2:30-4:30.  It is something we regret to do, but we have to for two reasons.  First, as we are expecting a strong turnout, we want to make sure we are technically prepared with Zoom technology and avoid any wasted time.  Second, there are two valued members of our EC, and possible participants, who will be unable to attend this Thursday due to a departmental meeting.  We never would have scheduled the meeting for this Thursday if we had known there was going to be a departmental meeting.  This is a decision the entire EC made and we regret to postpone this meeting for five days, but we hope you understand.</p>
<p>Lastly, at the chapter meeting next Tuesday, June 9, we will be announcing a summer campaign of actions as we continue our struggle to fully fund CUNY, save jobs, and make sure the health and safety of all our members, HEOs, CLTs and faculty, are made a priority for this administration.</p>
<p>We wish everyone safety and health,</p>
<p>george emilio sanchez chapter chair
