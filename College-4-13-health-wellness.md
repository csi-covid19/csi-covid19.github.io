To the CSI Community:
  
While CSI Health & Wellness is currently operating 100% remotely, we are committed to continue helping students during this time for non-emergency health questions and concerns.  Our nurses and nurse practitioner will assist with reproductive health concerns including how to access birth control, emergency contraception, STI/HIV testing, as well as general medical care and health insurance guidance.
 
You can contact us by email at healthcenter@csi.cuny.edu or leave a  phone message at 718.982.3045.  Please be sure to leave your email address and phone number.   
 
In these times the 911 system is severely overwhelmed and a response can be delayed as much as or more than 30 minutes, so only if you have medical emergency, such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain or bleeding, continue to use 911. For urgent issues, please call your primary care provider or your local urgent care center.
