<p>&#40;Deja Vu all over again...&#41;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html">7/22 Congressional Republicans ready for revolt</a> &#40;Thanks Ned Benton, JJ&#41;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said on Tuesday that the &#36;105 billion for education would include about &#36;70 billion for elementary, middle and high schools, with more money available to school districts that reopen in the fall. Senate Democrats have put forward legislation that would provide &#36;430 billion to schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“They’re going to have more expenses, transportation and petitions and different ways to have meals than they’ve had in the past,” Mr. Blunt said, adding that &#36;30 billion would be set aside for colleges and universities and &#36;5 billion for governors to use at their discretion.</p>

<p><a href="https://diverseeducation.com/article/184261/">7/22 Too Early to Assess Fall Enrollment at Community Colleges, Say Experts</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the City University of New York &#40;CUNY&#41; said it has seen a surge in summer session enrollment. All institutions across the CUNY system, which includes two-year, four-year and graduate schools, have posted an overall 17&#37; increase. CUNY’s seven community colleges have shown a 5&#37; increase.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The growth of our summer enrollment is a product of CUNY’s first-class academics, extraordinary affordability and the outstanding outcomes our graduates can expect,” said CUNY chancellor Dr. Félix V. Matos Rodríguez in a press statement. “We are thrilled to provide access to high-quality distance education programs in these uncertain times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://csi-covid19.github.io/UFS/7-21-enrollment.pdf">yet</a> it looks to this untrained eye that the Community Colleges are getting a triple whammy:  reduced city funding &#40;a 1&#37; increase to cover 5&#43;&#37; expenditure increases&#41;; a 10&#37; decline in enrollments &#40;due to COVID&#41; and changing CUNY policies are making it easier for students to enter CUNY as senior college students; a 20M reduction ASAP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Colleges and universities can successfully navigate coronavirus perils with prudence and lots of creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, public universities especially are facing a host of financial pressures that only extra funding from the federal government can alleviate. With state revenues shrinking due to Covid, universities sorely need an infusion of aid beyond the &#36;14 billion available through the Cares Act, the &#36;2 trillion coronavirus relief package that Congress passed in March. For example, Rutgers University in New Jersey has taken a &#36;183 million hit so far; only &#36;27 million of that will be made up by funds from the Cares Act.</p>
