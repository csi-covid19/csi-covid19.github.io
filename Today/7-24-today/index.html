<blockquote>
<p>Amidst the unprecedented challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the City University of New York Athletic Conference and member Athletic Directors have made the difficult decision to cancel all intercollegiate competition, both traditional and non-traditional, scheduled for the 2020 fall semester.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo is warning incoming SUNY and CUNY freshmen he may have to slash the tuition relief program for middle class families because of the fiscal crisis fueled by the coronavirus crisis — unless the federal government delivers a rescue package.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said on Tuesday that the &#36;105 billion for education would include about &#36;70 billion for elementary, middle and high schools, with more money available to school districts that reopen in the fall. Senate Democrats have put forward legislation that would provide &#36;430 billion to schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“They’re going to have more expenses, transportation and petitions and different ways to have meals than they’ve had in the past,” Mr. Blunt said, adding that &#36;30 billion would be set aside for colleges and universities and &#36;5 billion for governors to use at their discretion.</p>

<p><a href="https://diverseeducation.com/article/184261/">7/22 Too Early to Assess Fall Enrollment at Community Colleges, Say Experts</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the City University of New York &#40;CUNY&#41; said it has seen a surge in summer session enrollment. All institutions across the CUNY system, which includes two-year, four-year and graduate schools, have posted an overall 17&#37; increase. CUNY’s seven community colleges have shown a 5&#37; increase.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The growth of our summer enrollment is a product of CUNY’s first-class academics, extraordinary affordability and the outstanding outcomes our graduates can expect,” said CUNY chancellor Dr. Félix V. Matos Rodríguez in a press statement. “We are thrilled to provide access to high-quality distance education programs in these uncertain times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Colleges and universities can successfully navigate coronavirus perils with prudence and lots of creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, public universities especially are facing a host of financial pressures that only extra funding from the federal government can alleviate. With state revenues shrinking due to Covid, universities sorely need an infusion of aid beyond the &#36;14 billion available through the Cares Act, the &#36;2 trillion coronavirus relief package that Congress passed in March. For example, Rutgers University in New Jersey has taken a &#36;183 million hit so far; only &#36;27 million of that will be made up by funds from the Cares Act.</p>
