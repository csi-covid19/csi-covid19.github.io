## College Council and Faculty Senate

* [5/9 President Fritz email  on budget task force](/CCFS/5-9-president)

In case there are any doubts this is clear: the adminstration has taken total ownership of the crisis and the havoc it will wreak on the campus. This should not be forgotten as we transition from pandemic to pandemonium come Fall 2020. [ed.]

* [5/9 President Fritz email  on clarity of process](/CCFS/5-9-president-2)

In which we hear:

...I have been discussing with P&B for a number of weeks that our scenarios might be even deeper than the 35% so there has been some time for planning. ....


* [5/9 College Council Chair's personal response to President Fritz](/CCFS/5-9-CC-chair-response)

...Your plan falls short. The plan proposed by the College Council and Faculty Senate gave a mechanism and a foundation to give the campus meaningful input into the campus response, which due to the scale, must be widespread. Now you have personally assumed ownership of the process, its results, and the inevitable fallout.

[link](/PSC/5-11-psc) Act Now: No Cuts to CUNY!

[link](/PSC/5-11-adjunct) CSI Adjuncts send out campus letter

[link](https://www.psc-cuny.org/psc-impact-bargaining-proposals) The  PSC lists its proposals  including:

There will be no non-reappointments or dismissals of PSC-represented employees during the pandemic except for just cause, pursuant to Article 21 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
	
Class-size limits and minimum required class enrollments will not change from past practice for financial reasons during the COVID emergency. If social distancing is still required when on-site instruction resumes, the University will create additional faculty positions rather than reducing course offerings, increasing faculty workload or relying on technological solutions.

## Budget

* [5/9 memo to CSI Chairs -- adjuncts cuts](/College/5-9-provost-adjuncts)

Carlos Serrano has provided each Dean with financial targets that show the dollar amounts that would correspond to a 35% cut within each school/division. The Deans have discretion to provide for variation within departments, but each school/division should aim to meet the specified targets for Fall 2020.


* [5/8 memo to JJ Chairs -- no reappointment of 6-month adjuncts](/CUNY/5-11-jj) John Jay "will be issuing non-reappointment letters to all one-semester adjuncts by May 15, 2020, our contractual deadline."
