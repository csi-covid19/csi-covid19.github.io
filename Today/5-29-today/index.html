<p><a href="/CUNY/5-28-testimony">5/28 Testimony by Chancellor to Reimagining Education Committee</a></p>
<p>We know there are many factors to be considered, and numerous entities to be aligned prior to deciding and communicating a final way forward for CUNY but I thought it would be good to share why our thinking today is that a mostly online semester is our most prudent option for the fall. We believe it is the best way for CUNY to secure safety, ensure equity, maintain academic momentum for our students and continue to be the nation’s leading engine of social mobility. It is consistent with the advice of an increasing number of health experts, and it is the course being adopted by institutions such as the California State University, the nation’s largest system of public higher education with 23 campuses and half a million students.</p>
<p>Let me be clear that no final decision has been made but in determining what the best possible course of action for the Fall could be, we are considering a range of factors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in guidance sent to faculty and staff last week, which was shared with Gothamist, CUNY officials appeared to acknowledge that remote learning will continue for their students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference in what CUNY and the private universities are planning to offer go beyond setting foot in a physical classroom – the very foundations of the educational experience are dramatically different between remote and physical learning, one education expert said. These differences are compounded for lower-income students, which CUNY has historically served as a self-proclaimed “transformative engine of social mobility that is a critical component of the lifeblood of New York City.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is a huge problem. And of course, again, we really don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen at any of these institutions yet,” said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow for the Center on Education Data and Policy at the Urban Institute, in a phone interview on Tuesday. “The evidence about online learning is that it made it very clear that the students who suffer the most, who struggle with the online coursework, are low-income students without strong academic preparation. If you know how to learn already, then you can do your courses online. But if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re really going to struggle.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hunter, the CUNY student &#40;and USS President&#41;, pointed out that remote learning or not some things will remain the same at the school.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Regardless, if we go back to classes in person or not, we&#39;re going to be going back to overcrowded classes,” he said. “That&#39;s a guarantee – you know, classes where we&#39;re probably going to have a Zoom call, and there&#39;s going to be one professor and maybe 80 students on.”</p>
