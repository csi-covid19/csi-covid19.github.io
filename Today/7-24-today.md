Senate Democrats have put forward legislation that would provide \$430 billion to schools.

> “They’re going to have more expenses, transportation and petitions and different ways to have meals than they’ve had in the past,” Mr. Blunt said, adding that \$30 billion would be set aside for colleges and universities and \$5 billion for governors to use at their discretion.

> Meanwhile, the City University of New York (CUNY) said it has seen a surge in summer session enrollment. All institutions across the CUNY system, which includes two-year, four-year and graduate schools, have posted an overall 17% increase. CUNY’s seven community colleges have shown a 5% increase.

> “The growth of our summer enrollment is a product of CUNY’s first-class academics, extraordinary affordability and the outstanding outcomes our graduates can expect,” said CUNY chancellor Dr. Félix V.

> Colleges and universities can successfully navigate coronavirus perils with prudence and lots of creativity.

> Indeed, public universities especially are facing a host of financial pressures that only extra funding from the federal government can alleviate. With state revenues shrinking due to Covid, universities sorely need an infusion of aid beyond the \$14 billion available through the Cares Act, the \$2 trillion coronavirus relief package that Congress passed in March. For example, Rutgers University in New Jersey has taken a \$183 million hit so far; only \$27 million of that will be made up by funds from the Cares Act.
