## College

* Research re-opening meeting

Topic: Research re-opening meeting
Time: Aug 5, 2020 07:00 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)
 
[Join Zoom Meeting](https://gc-cuny.zoom.us/j/94878137289?pwd=VUVydUpscFF1ZlhzamxwK1NXSWNvUT09)

> We have therefore scheduled a Zoom meeting for affected faculty this Wednesday, August 5, at 7 pm, to discuss re-opening plans and share ideas and best practices (Zoom details are below). Of course, such a meeting would be most useful with participation of members of the Administration who were involved in crafting of the submitted College plan and will be coordinating the approval and implementation of individual investigators’ re-opening plans. 

> Timeline: 7/8 Research plan presented to college administration; 7/17 plan forwarded to CUNY after review; 7/30 sent back to college for revision; 7/31 revision sent in; 8/3 Sent to EVC Cruz for approval

## PSC

* [8/3 email from Chapter Chair](/PSC/8-3-cchair)

> I am also reaching out to let everyone know we’ll hold our next chapter meeting this Thursday, August 6 at 2:30. 

* [7/30 PSC Escalates](/PSC/7-30-escalate)

> The Executive Council voted unanimously to support the ten demands that follow and to put all options on the table for union action if our demands are not satisfactorily addressed by the start of the academic year. Enough mismanagement and stonewalling by the CUNY administration! Lives are at stake.



## CUNY/NYC/NYS

* [7/30 Budget update from Chancellor](/CUNY/7-30-fiscal)

> We have almost completed the allocation of the \$118 million CARES Act funds in direct aid to students. Because we moved promptly upon receiving the funds, we were one of the first Universities in the nation to distribute the funds starting on May 22. Regarding the \$132 million of CARES Act funding that is to be allocated directly to the campuses, we submitted a plan to the State that prioritized student support and mental health services, reimbursements to campuses for COVID 19-related costs such as refunds, and investments in online infrastructure and training. We are optimistic that this student-centered approach will promote maintenance of our overall enrollment levels and sustain our students’ academic momentum. That plan has been approved by the State, but we have decided to postpone the use of these funds until we conclude our budget process, in case adjustments are required. In light of the financial uncertainties we face, this is the most prudent way to proceed.

> Those increases, however, are offset by an additional \$25.3 million in efficiency targets above those announced for FY 2020. This means that CUNY’s total savings target from the City for FY 2021 is \$46.3 million, about 9% of the community colleges’ total operating budget.
