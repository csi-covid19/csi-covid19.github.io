The state and the Gates Foundation will consider what education should look like in the future, including:

* How can we use technology to provide more opportunities to students no matter where they are;
* How can we provide shared education among schools and colleges using technology;
* How can technology reduce educational inequality, including English as a new language students;
* How can we use technology to meet educational needs of students with disabilities;
* How can we provide educators more tools to use technology;
* How can technology break down barriers to K-12 and Colleges and Universities to provide greater access to high quality education no matter where the student lives; and
* Given ongoing socially distancing rules, how can we deploy classroom technology, like immersive cloud virtual classrooms learning, to recreate larger class or lecture hall environments in different locations?
