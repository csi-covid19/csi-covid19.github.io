## College

### College Council and  Faculty Senate meeting

On 5/21 we had a  College Council meeting. In the  chairs  report we saw this prediction:


> As for other less drastic means, I have yet to hear of contingency plans by the college beyond this, but you can be sure the next areas that **would** be announced come from the temporary personnel budge are: College Assistants, Graduate Assistants,  and research infrastructure  (animal lab facility, HPCC,...)



(Pardon the editorial   comments below,  but  it was  all  so predicdtable):

On 5/22, at  General Chairs  it was  announced that the Plan to  Eliminate the Gap (PEG II, as we  already had   PEG):

* targeting non-reappointment - $4.8M worth of adjuncts
* Reduce NTAs - $500,000   (BTW,  graduate  students can be so  classified)
* CA budget by 2M – July 1 – 30% of budget. That  is about  150  CAs!
* 500,000 from unsponsored research (that is research infrastructure)
* Gains from vacancies - +1.2 M from attrition; (that is  we  aren't replacing any faculty that separate)
* $400,000 in savings from transportation – eliminate tax levy – because not students using. (The students  will be paying for  less)
* Energy savings – some energy savings - $250,000 (or about 5%  of that budgett)


Meanwhile, the hope that the  second half of  the CARES act funding  (~6M) would be diirectly beneficial for  the campus appears not  to  be  the case, as the college will  need  to demonstrate past or  future expenses related to the coronavirus. This may be a boon  for  addressing  infrastructure  needs, but less likely,  it  appears,  to address  the pending state budget

* [5/21  Nation article: If Cuomo Cuts Funding, CUNY Layoffs Will Be a ‘Bloodbath’](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/new-york-cuomo-cuny-cuts/)

Cuomo has governed New York state since 2011. State aid to CUNY, adjusted for inflation, has declined by nearly 5 percent during his tenure, though the state’s gross domestic product has increased.

At the same time, CUNY tuition has steadily risen. A New York State resident who is a full-time student at a four-year CUNY school now pays $6,930 a year, up from $5,130 in 2011. New York’s Tuition Assistance Program, which provides aid to students below a certain income threshold, no longer covers the full cost of tuition, and Cuomo forces individual colleges to make up the difference. Another tuition increase of $200 per year, along with a $120 “health and wellness” fee, is set to be voted on by the CUNY Board of Trustees in June.

“We were in short notice, asked to leave the dorms, and being an international student I have no family here to stay with,” said Nicole Agu, a College of Staten Island student and USS Vice Chair of International Student Affairs.

Agu explained that with the advocacy of USS, international students who were not able to leave the country were replaced in Queens College dormitories.
