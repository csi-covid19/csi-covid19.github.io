Dear Francisco,

Could you arrange for this to be sent out to the College Council mailing list? Many thanks. All best, --John


A summary of recent news over the past few days from various sources is now online at

https://csi-covid19.github.io/Today/8-21-today/


Highlights:

Lots of things, but this seems not to have made it out yet. From the Guidance update #19:

NEW Recording of Remote Classes:

* faculty offering classes through web conferencing digital technology like Zoom must not record a student in a class session without the studentâ€™s consent.
*  faculty who wish to record their class sessions must provide the following announcement, in emails, and/or class syllabus, to enrolled students and verbally at the opening of the first class session:



	Students who participate in this class with their camera on or use
    a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded
    solely for the purpose of creating a record for students enrolled
    in the class to refer to, including those enrolled students who
    are unable to attend live.  If you are unwilling to consent to
    have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your
    camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who
    un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have
    their voices recorded.  If you are not willing to consent to have
    your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute
    button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat"
    feature, which allows students to type questions and comments
    live.
