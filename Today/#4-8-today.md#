This 4/7 article says:

The CSI field hospital was initially supposed to have 1,000 hospital beds, but the Army Corps of Engineers told the Advance Friday the facility would now contain 1,030 beds.

The Corps said last week it completed a preliminary design for a “150 bed alternate care facility” at CSI, which it hoped to award a contract to “soon.”

Asked last week when the state’s new downstate field hospitals would open, Cuomo could not provide a clear timeline either.

Instead, the governor said the additional field hospitals would open “when we need them,” describing them as the “last of the last resort” sites which you would still need equipment and staff.
