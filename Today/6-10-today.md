> The Great Recession brought many more students—and more state budget cuts—to community colleges. College leaders turned to tuition and fees, federal stimulus, and other revenue sources to partially make up for these state funding shortfalls. But the magnitude of the shocks caused by COVID-19 suggests that colleges may experience even steeper and more rapid cuts in state funding and be less able to draw on tuition and other revenue sources as a back-up this time around.
