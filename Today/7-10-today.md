* [7/9 PSC Chair letter to board to prevent resolution](/PSC/7-9-chair-response)

PSC Chair mails the Board requesting consultation prior to voting on instruction for fall.

> While it may be that the PSC would not disagree with many of the provisions of the proposed resolution, submitting the resolution for a vote without any consultation with the PSC is a violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, quite possibly a violation of the NYS reopening guidelines, and a profound insult to the faculty and professional staff on whose work the University depends.

* [7/9 Harvard and MIT sue](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/07/09/harvard-and-mit-sue-block-new-rule-international-students-and-online-enrollment)

> Harvard and MIT argue in their lawsuit that the policy change announced Monday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement threw virtually all of U.S. higher education “into chaos.” They say the decision, which would make international students enrolled exclusively in online courses subject to deportation, puts colleges in “the untenable situation of either moving forward with their carefully calibrated, thoughtful, and difficult decisions to proceed with their curricula fully or largely online in the fall of 2020 … or to attempt, with just weeks before classes resume, to provide in-person education despite the grave risk to public health and safety that such a change would entail.”
