* [7/9 PSC Chair letter to board to prevent resolution](/PSC/7-9-chair-response)

PSC Chair mails the Board requesting consultation prior to voting on instruction for fall.

> While it may be that the PSC would not disagree with many of the provisions of the proposed resolution, submitting the resolution for a vote without any consultation with the PSC is a violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, quite possibly a violation of the NYS reopening guidelines, and a profound insult to the faculty and professional staff on whose work the University depends.
