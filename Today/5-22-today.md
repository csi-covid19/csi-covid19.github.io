* [5/21  Nation article: If Cuomo Cuts Funding, CUNY Layoffs Will Be a ‘Bloodbath’](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/new-york-cuomo-cuny-cuts/)

Cuomo has governed New York state since 2011. State aid to CUNY, adjusted for inflation, has declined by nearly 5 percent during his tenure, though the state’s gross domestic product has increased.

At the same time, CUNY tuition has steadily risen. A New York State resident who is a full-time student at a four-year CUNY school now pays $6,930 a year, up from $5,130 in 2011. New York’s Tuition Assistance Program, which provides aid to students below a certain income threshold, no longer covers the full cost of tuition, and Cuomo forces individual colleges to make up the difference. Another tuition increase of $200 per year, along with a $120 “health and wellness” fee, is set to be voted on by the CUNY Board of Trustees in June.

“We were in short notice, asked to leave the dorms, and being an international student I have no family here to stay with,” said Nicole Agu, a College of Staten Island student and USS Vice Chair of International Student Affairs.

Agu explained that with the advocacy of USS, international students who were not able to leave the country were replaced in Queens College dormitories.
