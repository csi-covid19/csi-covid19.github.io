> ... CUNY campuses have thousands of international students whose status is threatened by the new rule. These students are a valuable and a vital part of our community.  I have instructed my administration to explore and pursue measures that would help these students remain in the country and continue their education at CUNY. We will also be joining forces with other universities and national organizations to further support those affected by these restrictions and pursue all viable legal remedies to humanize these rules.

> What we decided
 

> For undergraduates Keeping the whole community safe will require that everyone living or working on campus be tested for the virus as often as twice a week, that each undergraduate living on campus has a private room and that the overall campus population – students, faculty, postdocs and staff – be kept far below our normal levels. Those constraints mean that we can invite back only a limited number of undergraduates for the Fall term.

Read on for how they decided, as their process is very thorough.
