* [8/14 Message from the president](/College/8-14-president)

> Importantly, I am pleased to report that our plans for re-starting research activity, re-opening the dorms and the dining area have been approved by CUNY and New York State.  Please keep in mind, however, that while these plans have been approved, and others await approval, any required actions that need to be taken before implementation may take time and could delay our return.  Our initial phase of opening academic buildings is focused on buildings 5N, 5S, and 6S.  Once those buildings are ready for opening, it will allow researchers to return to campus and for faculty to hold limited classes involving laboratory, studio and clinical experiences that require in person instruction.  Apart from these very few exceptions, we anticipate that the rest of our classes will be delivered remotely for the Fall semester.  Academic Affairs will keep students apprised when any of the limited aforementioned courses or experiences will be able to make the transition from remote to in person instruction.

Will CUNY's contractual increase be withheld?

> (p52)  Due to the adverse financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the State is withholding the general salary increases that were scheduled to go into effect on April 1, 2020. The current Financial Plan reflects only the liquidity benefit of the withholding. If a decision is made to withhold the full amount for the fiscal year, it would provide savings of \$215 million in FY 2021 and offset the need for reductions elsewhere in the budget.

 
 No budget uncertainty until late in the second quarter:
 
 > (p17) The Enacted Budget Financial Plan noted that the ultimate size of any permanent reductions would depend in part on the availability of unrestricted Federal aid. While the U.S. Congress has begun discussions on additional recovery legislation, no agreement has been reached as of the date of this Quarterly Update. Therefore, the earliest that DOB now expects to transmit a detailed aid-to- localities reduction plan to the Legislature is late in the second quarter of the State’s FY 2021.


> In the interim, without assurance of Federal aid, DOB has begun withholding a minimum of 20 percent of most local aid payments to achieve the cash flow savings anticipated in the Updated Financial Plan pursuant to the Reduction Authority. As of July 31, 2020, DOB has withheld roughly \$361 million pursuant to the Reduction Authority. In addition, DOB is withholding a range of other payments, including local aid payments that do not have specific statutory payment dates and liabilities, transfers to other funds, and general salary increases that were scheduled to take effect on April 1. DOB estimates that such withholdings have totaled a minimum of \$1.9 billion through the end of the first quarter.

> The Updated Financial Plan assumes that the Federal government will fully fund the State’s direct cost for pandemic response. Aid is expected through FEMA disaster assistance grants and aid, and the CRF. Accordingly, the Updated Financial Plan reflects no net State costs from COVID-19 related expenses. However, the Updated Financial Plan has been revised to reflect reclassifications of eligible expenses incurred in the prior year and payroll expenses for public health and safety employees to the Federal CRF pursuant to U.S. Treasury eligibility guidelines.


p24 shows a 18.6% reduction in receipts for taxes (from 73.133M to 59.528M).
