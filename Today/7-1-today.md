## College



* [6/24 notes for Budget Committee](/CCFS/6-24-budget)

> We heard that the following was shared with P&B: **contingency** plans for bad scenarios include 3M reduction in the CA budget. (Emphasize, this is part of a plan and may not come to pass). (3M in CAs is *about* 200 1020-hour lines).

(Sadly, this does appear to be happening...)

> Since Governor Andrew Cuomo announced in April that New York State’s budget could be slashed by as much as \$10 billion because of the pandemic, local governments across the state have been left to wonder how much money would be left over for public schools, transportation, roadways, and social services when the cutting is done.
