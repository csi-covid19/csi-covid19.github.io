<h1 id="recent_news"><a href="#recent_news">Recent news</a></h1>
<p>A summary of some new news related to CUNY&#39;s and CSI&#39;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See <a href="https://csi-covid19.github.io/">https://csi-covid19.github.io</a> for the archive.</p>

<h2 id="college"><a href="#college">College</a></h2>
<p>At a  5/27  Town Hall over  250 members of the  community showed up. None were  happy coming in and none had any reason to  be happy on leaving.</p>
<p>The words &quot;retrenchment&quot; and &quot;furlough&quot; were used  as  an  alternate possibility  to  dramatic cuts to the temporary  personnel  budget   &#40;Adjuncts, CAs, graduate  assistants, NTAs...&#41;. </p>
<p>In  comments  about the 5/27 P&amp;B meeting, it was heard that 128 CAs were on the bubble; that the president wants  credit for saving money  on positions he chose not to  have but  is  &quot;chartered&quot; to have &#40;whatevere that means&#41;; and that some feel  the  &quot;consultation&quot; process is not real.</p>
<p>It was  heard  that  despite  calling 40&#43;  people together  for the  reopening  committee  on  5/26;  at least   two   committees were being  formed in  parallel  for  research and  many  more  may  be needed.</p>
<p>May 28th would have been our day for graduation and the announcement  of Dolphin Awards. Sadly these  seem to  have been an unitended victim of the pandemic.</p>
<h2 id="psc"><a href="#psc">PSC</a></h2>
<p><a href="/PSC/5-27-meeting-call">5/27 email  calling for special meeting</a> Several members of the  college   community ask for a special meeting to,  the purpose of the meeting is  to debate  and vote on a resolution.</p>

<p>Clarifies the  PSC  position on a grade strike &#40;defeated  twice by  vote&#41;  and mentions  upcoming meeting  with President Fritz.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/opinion/cuny-cuts-ben-lerner.html">5/26 CUNY Distinguished faculty Ben  Lerner on the cuts</a> &#40;thanks  to Alyson B. for pointing this   out&#41;</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t take a Guggenheim Fellow  or MacArthur fellow to  know  this, but it helps get the impact across</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Remaining classes will then  swell, which  is  bad for in-person education, but worse if classes  remain  online, as anybody who has tried to  teach on Zoom can attest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cuts to the adjunct budget have <em>no other</em>  translation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amny.com/education-2/faculty-union-launches-ad-campaign-opposing-anticipated-cuny-adjunct-and-part-staff-layoffs/">5/26 Faculty union launches ad campaign opposing anticipated CUNY adjunct and part-time staff layoffs</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite funding from the CARES Act, which allocated &#36;237 million to CUNY to split equally for direct student aid and institutional needs stemming from the pandemic, some faculty and CUNY colleges are preparing for the worst. Brooklyn College, College of Staten Island, John Jay College, and Queens College have all announced plans to make significant cuts to their adjunct faculty and part-time staff.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no justification for the terminations of employment and, in many cases, of health insurance that CUNY colleges have announced,” said President of the Professional Staff Congress Barbara Bowen.“Taking such actions at any time would be alarming; doing so in the midst of a pandemic after receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is inexcusable. CUNY must do better.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And CUNY Chancellor Felix Matos Rodriguez’s salary is &#36;623,500; joining the cap &#40;200K maximum salary&#41; could pay for a dozen adjunct profs.</p>
