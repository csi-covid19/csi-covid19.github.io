* [5/16 Advance article: College of Staten Island urged not to cut staff amid potential budget cuts](https://www.silive.com/coronavirus/2020/05/college-of-staten-island-urged-not-to-cut-staff-amid-potential-budget-cuts.html)

George Sanchez, chair of the Professional Staff Congress (PSC) union -- CSI chapter, said the college was discussing the possibility of department chairs cutting 35% of adjunct faculty.

“The best thing that happened was the president was asking for the department chairs to give a list of names for adjuncts that would amount for 35% of cuts in the different departments,” said Sanchez. “The chairs resisted that and it was quite a lot of back and forth, people saying, ‘No, no no.’ What happened this [Monday] morning was the administration did not insist on that -- and basically it was business as usual.”

Sanchez said he believes the pull-back from CSI was due to the resistance of department chairs.

“I think the main reason was people were saying, ‘We’re not going to do anything without looking at the budget’ and they haven’t agreed to that yet,” Sanchez added.

A spokesperson for CSI wouldn’t confirm that the college has been discussing cuts to the adjunct faculty staff.
