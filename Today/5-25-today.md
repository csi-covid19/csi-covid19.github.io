[City  College  Budget  Memo from their president](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/presidentsoffice/blog/budget-memo-president-boudreau)  [Framework principles](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/presidentsoffice/blog/framework-budget-reductions)


> We have, in the past, waited too long to make the kinds of cuts necessary to navigate our crises.  We have also perhaps been insufficiently consultative.  I would like to do things differently this yearâ€”embarking upon an early effort to develop a strategy for next year and mobilizing the energies and commitments of the campus to achieve our goals. I am therefore launching a budget process that is both timely, clear-eyed, and open to the participation of the whole campus.  

> It is my hope that by acting early and moving as a campus, we will be able to do the best and fairest job possible. 

> I am not able, at this moment, to present a fully realized budget plan for next year, and would not want to develop that plan without significant input from the campus. 

> College-wide values during this crisis will be prioritized, at least preliminarily, in the following ways:

*  Teach every student admitted to the college, and make sure that, insofar as possible, the quality of our teaching is maintained. Do not interrupt progress to graduation.
*  Preserve the employment of employees insofar as possible, and try to ensure the welfare of everyone in our community. Think about the relationship between salaries we can offer and public benefits so that nobody is left without some means of support.
* Sustain research, writing, and the development of our intellectual life.
*  Remain engaged with students, with public service efforts
