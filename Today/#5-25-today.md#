[City  College  Budget  Memo from their president]()  [Framework principles](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/presidentsoffice/blog/framework-budget-reductions)


> We have, in the past, waited too long to make the kinds of cuts necessary to navigate our crises.  We have also perhaps been insufficiently consultative.  I would like to do things differently this yearâ€”embarking upon an early effort to develop a strategy for next year and mobilizing the energies and commitments of the campus to achieve our goals. I am therefore launching a budget process that is both timely, clear-eyed, and open to the participation of the whole campus.  

> It is my hope that by acting early and moving as a campus, we will be able to do the best and fairest job possible. 

> I am not able, at this moment, to present a fully realized budget plan for next year, and would not want to develop that plan without significant input from the campus.
