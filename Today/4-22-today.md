## Budget tea  leaves

The Chancellor has informed the BoT that the University has submitted
a proposal to the NYS Division of the Budget for distributing
\$118,477,183 in CARES Act funding. When approved, the monies will be
sent to our students, particularly but not exclusively, Pell Grant
recipients.
 
The Federal government has also released guidelines for the use of the
   second half of those monies: an additional \$118, 477, 183. The
   Chancellery is reviewing them and will develop a plan for disbursal
   as well, pending the approval of the NYS Division of the Budget.

The Chancellor has alerted the members of the BoT to "fluid fiscal
   concerns" which may effect and to "potentially difficult decisions"
   that may be pending. Specifics about the concerns and the decisions
   were not provided.
